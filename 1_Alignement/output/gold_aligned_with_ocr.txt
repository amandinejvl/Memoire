ATTEMPTED MURDER OF A MERCHANT. AT the Bow-street Police-court, five men named James Palmer, Samuel Scandland, Leon Weiner, Adolphe Weiner, and Daniel Jacoby, have been charged with being concerned with a man (already convicted) named Dusant, with attempting to@ murder Jules Tabak, a diamond merchant, and steal@@in@g £2,000 worth of diamonds. Inspector Languish deposed that from information received he went with other officers and arrested the accused on the present charge. Mr. Tab@ak, a diam@ond merchant@ of 5@ Belgrave-street, Euston-road, deposed that on M@@arch 25t@@h, two men cam@e to his house, a@nd asked him to show them some diam@onds. Two parcels were shown them. While the men were looking@ at the diamonds the prisoner Palmer struck witness t@o heavy blows on the head. He was stunned, the two men ran away, and stole one hundred and eighty carats of diam@onds, value £1,4@00. One of the men@@ (Dusant) was arrested, and has since been convicted and sentenced to penal servitude. He positively identified Palmer as the other man. M@rs. Ta@bak@ was called, and identified Palmer as one of the men con@@cerned in the robbery. She did not identify him at@ first. Eleanor Denunzio, the daugh@ter of the man Dusant, deposed that on March 25th, the day of the robbery, the prisoner Palmer called on her and beckoned her to the corner of the street. He asked for her father. He said, “@@I struck the old man. He screamed, and his wife came upstairs and we were obliged to run away. I daresay your father @will blame me for all this, but my brother was outside and did all he could to stop the servant.” Witness asked if the servant was stopped. Prisoner replied in the negative. She asked if her father had got away. Prisoner replied, “@No,” and told her she had better pack up her luggage and@ get away from the house at once, and leave her luggage in the cloak@@@room@. He said,@ “You know where Weiner lives. You @must go down to him and tell him to assist you@ @Witness packed up her luggage and took it to Waterloo Station, and afterwards went to Ado@lphs W@einer’s house. She packed the luggage and se@nt it to Wa@terloo Station the sa@me day. She then wen@t to 6, Dyer’s Buildings@ and saw Adolphe Weinger. Directly he saw her he said@ “For God’s sake go awa@@@@y@! I will meet you in@ Castle-street.” She went there, w@here he shortly joined her, and took her to a w@ine shop @in Chancery lane. Witness said, “@You have got my father into this trouble, and I sh@all ex@@pect you to get him out of it.” He denied at first that he knew anything about it. She told him that her father had told her about the affair from@ the beginning. He@ said that all he did was to get her father a situation. She said she k@now that was false, and that he spent her father to M@r. Tabak, first he had said he would not assist her at all, and @then he gave her 5s@., and said he would give h@er that every we@ek until she got employment. H@@e said whatever she did she m@ust no@t come near Dyer’s@ Buildings, because he@ was watched. The@ s@@he went to Jacoby’s house, but he was not at hom@e.
