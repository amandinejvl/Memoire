Sir Lionel Flamstead. I have called it a dining-room, from its ordinary application to the purposes of refection and festivity; but it had much more the air of a library, or study. It was s small comfortable chamber, just large enough to contain half a dozen people, though by management double that number had been occasionally squeezed into its narrow limits. The walle were decorated with curious old prints, maps and plans, set in old black wormeaten frames, and representing divers personages, places, and structures connected with London and its history. I Oser the mantelpiece was stretehed Vertne's copy of alph Aggas's famous survey of our ``great metropolis,'' made abont the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, or perhaps z little earlier, when it was scarcely so great a metropolis as at the present time, and when novelists, gentlemen of the press, cabmen, omnibus cads, and other illustrious personages were unborn and undreamced of; when St., Giles's, in lieu of its mysterious and Dedalian Seren Dials (which fSeen''), consisted of a little cluster of country houses, surroundel by a grove of elms; when a turreted wall girded in the City, from Aldgate to Grey Friars; when a pack of stag-hounds was kept in Finsbury-fields, and archers and cross-bowmen haunted the purlieus of the Spital; when he who strolled westward from Charing-cross (then no misnomer) beheld neither Opera House nor club-house, buta rustic lane, with a barn at one end, and a goodly assortment TE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. 209 of hay-cnrts and hay-stacks at the other; when the Thames was crossed by a single bridge, and that bridge looked like a street, and tho street itself like as row of palaces. On the right of this plan hung a asketch ot WIl Somers, jester to Henry VIII., after the picture by Holbein; on the left an engraving of Geoffrey Hudson, the diminutive attendant ot Henriettas Maria. This niche was deoted to portraits of the bluff king before mentioned, and his six spouses; that to the melancholy Charles and his family. Here, thoe Grent Fire of 1666, with its black profiles of houses, relieved by a sheet of '` bloody and malicious'' flame, formed as pleasant contrast to the icy wonders of tho Frost Fair, held on the IThames in 1684, when carriages wero drien through the lines of tents, and an ox was roasted on the water, to the infinite deleetation of the citizens. There Old Saint Paul'a (in the words of Vietor Hugo, `' one of those Gothic monuments so admirable and so irreparable''), and which is but ill replaced by the modern ``' bastard connterpart'' of the glorious fane of St. Peter at Rome, reared its venerable tower (not dome) and lofty spire to the sky. Next to St. Paul's came the reverend Abbey of Westminster, taken before it had been disfigured by the towers adde by Wren; and next to the abbey opened the long and raftered vista of its magnificent neighbouring hall.

Bcareely an old edifice, to which an historicnl tradition could be attached (and what old London edifics is destitute of such traditions7), was wanting. Nor were the great of old--the spirits, who gave interest and endurance to these decayed, or decaying structures, wanting. But I shsll not pause to enumerate their portraite, or make out a catalogue as long as the list of Homer's slips, or the gallery of Mr. Lodge. Sufficient has been said, I trust, to give the reader an idea of th physiology of the room. Yet stay1 I must not omit ta point ont the ocontents of those groaning shelves. In the goodly folios crowded there are contained the chronicles of Holinshed and Hall; of Grafton, Fabian, and Stow; of Mathew of Paris, and his namesake of Westminster. Let him not be terrified nt the ponderous size of these sdmirable old historians, nor be deterred by the black letter, if he honld chance to open a volume. Their freshness and picturesque details will surprise as mueh as they will delight him. From this wealthy miue Shakspeare drew some of his purest ore. The shelves are crowned by a solitary bust. It is that of a modern. It is that of a loer of London, and a character of London. It is Docros onxso. Haring completed the survrey of the apartment, I shall now proceed to its oecupants. These were fie in number -jolly fllows sll-seated round a circular dining-tabl covered with glasses and decanterts, amidst which a portly magnum of claret, and a deep and caspacions china punehl----2 212 TIE OLD LONDON MEROEANT. bowl, must not pass unmentioned. They were in the full low of fun and conviviality; enjoying themsolves as good follows always enjoy themselves at `'` the season of the year.'' The port was delectable-old as Saint Paul's, I was going to say-not quite, however-but just `` old enough;'' the claret was nectar, or, what is better, it was Lnfitte; tho punch was drink for the gods. The jokes of this party would hae split your sides--their laughter wonld have had the senme effect on your ears. Neer were henrd peals of merriment so heuarty and prolonged. You only wondered low they found time to drink, so quick did each roar follow on the heels of its predecessor. That they did drink, howcver, was clear; that they had drunk was equally certain; and that they intended to continue drinking seemed to come within tho limits of probability. Sir Lionel Flamstead was a retired merchant-one of those high-souled, high-principled traders, of whom our City was onee so justly proud, and of whom so few, in these days of railway bubbles, and other harebrained speculations, can bo fonnd. His word was his bond-once passed, it was sufficient; his acceptances wcre acoounted safe as the Bank of England. Had Sir Thomas Greslam desecended from his niche he could not havo been treated with greater consideration than attended ir Lionel's appearance on 'Chnge. All eyes followed the movements of lis tall and stately figure-nll hats were raised to his courteous but eceremonious salutation. Affable, yet precise, and tinetnrel nE OLD LONDON IERCLAYT. 213 with something of the punctilionsness of the old school, his manners won him universal respect and regard, een from those unknown to him. By his intimates he was revered. His habits were as regular as cloekwork, and the glass of cold punch at Tom's, or the basin of soup at Birch's, wound him up for the duy. His attire was as formal as his manners, being a slight modification of the prealent costume of some fie-and-thirty years ago. He had consented, not without extreme reluctance, to clothe his nether limbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction; but he resolutely adhered to the pigtail. There is something, by-the-by, in a pigtail, to which old gentlemen cling in spite of all remonstrance, with lover-like pertinacity. Only hint the propriety of cutting it off to your great-unecla or your grandfather, and you may rely on being cut off with s shilling yoursolf. Be this as it may, Sir Lionel gnthered his locks, once sable as tho riband that bound tlem, but now thickly strewn with the sileer blossomns of the grave,' into a knot, and suffered them to dangle a few inches below his collar. His shoes shone with a lustre beyond French polish, and lis hat was brushed till not a wind dared to approach it. Sir Lionel wore a white, unstarched cravat, with a tbick pad in it, sported a frill over his waistcoat, carricd a black ebony cane in his hand, and was generally followed by s pet pg-dog, one of tha most sgacious and disagreeable speeimens of his species. Sir Lionel Flamstead, I have said, was tall-I might have said he was very tall-some214 TE oLD LODON ERCANT. what narrower across the shoulders than ahout the hips-a circumstance which did not materially conducee to his symmetry-with grey, benevrolent eyes, shaded by bnshy, intelligent brows-a lofty, expansive forehead, in which, in tho jrgon of phreuology, the organs of locality and ideality were strongly deeloped, and which was rendered the more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on either sido of the temples-with a nose which had been considered handsome and well proportioned in his youth, but to which good living had imparted a bottle form and a bottle tint-and cheeks from which all eneroachment of whiskers was sedulonsly removed, in order, we conclude, that his rosy eomplexion might be traced from its point of concentration, upon the prominent featnre befere mentioned, to its final disappearance behind his ears. Such was Sir Lionel Flamstead. --'7 A NII3 ADYENIURB I 0IE.

Ths Gray Botle, Caxona to be in Rome in the Angst of 1830, 1 visited the gorgeous church of anta Maria Maggiorse during the celebration of the anniversary of the HBoly Assumption. It was a glorious sight to one nnaceustomed to the imposing religious ceremonials of the Romish chureh, to wit216 A NIGII's ADVETURE N ROIE. ness all tho pomp and splendour displayed at this high eolemnity-to gaze down that glittering pile, and mark the various ecclesiastical dignitaries, eneh in their peculiar and] characteristio costume, employed in the ministration of thcir sncred functions, and snrrounded by a wide semicircle of theI papal guards, so stationed to keep back the crod, and who, with teir showy scarlet attire and tall halberds, looked like the martial figures we see in the sketches of Cnllot. Nor was the brilliant effeet of this picture diminished by the sumptuous framework in which it was set. Oerhead flamed a roof resplcndent with burnished gold; before me rose a canopy supported by pillars of porphyry, nnd shining with many-coloured stones; while on either hand were chapels devoted to some noble house, and boasting each the marble memorial of a pope. Melodious masses proper to the service were ever and anon chanted by the papal choir, and oerpowering perfume was diffused around by a hundred censers. Subdued by the odounrs, the music, and the spectaele, I sank into a state of dreamy enthusiasm, during a continuance of which I almost fancied myself a convert to the faith of Rome, and surrendered myself nnreflectingly to an admiration of its errors. As lI gazed among the surrounding crowd, tho sight of so many prostrate figures, all in attitudes of deepest deotion, satisfied me of the profound religious impression of the ceremonial. As elsewhere, this feeling was not nniversal; anl, as elsewhere, likewise, more -- A NIGET's ADETUE IN ROME. 217 zeal was exhibited by the lower than the higher classes of society; and I occasionally noted amongst the latter thae glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom, not altogethcr agitated, I suspect, by holy aspirastions. Yet methought, on the whole, I had never scen such abandonment of sonl, such prostration of spirit, in my own colder clime, and during the exerciso of my omn more chastened creed, as that wlich in several instances I now beheld; and I almost envied the poor maiden near me, who, abjeet upon the earth, had washed away her sorrows, and perhaps her sins, in contrite tears. As such thoughts swept through my mind, I felt a plessure in singling ont particnlar figures and groups which interested me, from their peculiarity of costume, or from their deotional feronr. Amongst others, a little to my left, I remarked a band of mountaineers from Calabria, for such I judged them to be from their wild and picturesque garb. Deeply wass every individual of this little knot of peasantry impressed by tho ceremonial. Every eye was humbly cast don; every knee bent; erery hand was either occupied in grasping the little crucifix suspended from its owner's neck, in telling the beads of his rosary, or foervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast While gazing upon this group, I chanced upon an individual whom I had not litherto noticed, and who now irresistibly attracted my attention. Thogh a little remoed from the Cualabrian mountaineers, and reclining against tha 218 A NIGn' ADENTURE N BOME. marble walls of the church, he eidently belongcd to tha same company; at least, so his attire seemed to indicate, though the noble cast of his countenance was far superior to that of his comrades. He ws an old man, with a face of the fine antique Roman stamp-a bold outline of prominent nose, rugged and imperious brow, and proudly-cut chin. His head and chin, as well as his naked breast, were frosted over with the snowy honours of many winters, and their hosr appearance contrasted strikingly with the tawny hue of a skin almost as dark and as lustronus as polished onk. Pensant as he was, there was somcthing of grandenr and msjesty in this old man's demeanour and physiognomy. IHis head declined backwards, eo as completely to expose his long and muscular throat. His arms hung listlessly by his side; one hand drooped upon the pavement, tlo other was placed within his breast: his eyes were closed. Tha old man's garb was of the coarsest fabric; he woro littlo beyond a slirt, a loose vest, a sort of sheep-skin cloak, and canvaes leggings bound around with leathern thongs. His appearance, however, was aboo his condition; he became his rags as proudly as a prince would have become his ermined robe. The more I serutinised the rigid lines of this old man's oonntenance, the more I became satisfied that many singular, and perhaps not wholly guiltless, erents were conneeted with his history. The rosary wass in his hand-tha eross upon his breast-the beads were untold-the orucifi ----A MIGRT's ADYETRE IR ROE. 219 nnelasped-no breath of prayer passed his lips. His faca was tumned eavenward, but his eyes were closed,-he dared not open them. Why did he come thither, if he did not ventnro to prayt Why did he assume a penitential attitude, if he felt no penitence So absorbed was I in the perusal of the workings of this old mnn's countenanee, as to be scnrcely conscious that the service of high masss was concluded, and the crowd within the holy pilo fast dispersing. The musie was hushed, tha robed prelates and their train had disappeared, joyous dames were hastening along the marble aisles to their eqnipages; all, save a few kneeling figures near the chapels, were departing; and the old man, aware, from the stir and hum prevailing around, that the ceremonial was at an end, arose, stretched ont his arm to one of his comrades, a youth who had joined him, and prepared to follow the concourse. Was he really blind? Aasuredly not. Besides, he did not walk like as one habitauated to the direst calamity that can befal onr nature. He staggered in his gait, and reeled to and fro. Yet wherefore did he not venture to unclose his eyes within the templo of the Most High7 What would I not hae gien to be made aequainted with his history I For I felt that it must be as singular one. I might satisfy my cnriosity at once. He was moving slowly forwasrd, guided by his comrade. In a few seconds it wonld be too late-he wonld have vnnished from my sight. With hasty footsteps I followed him dow the] 220 A NIGT's DYENTURE IN ROME. church, and laid my hand, with somne violence, upon his shoulder. Tho old man started at tha touch, and turned. Now, indeed, his eyes were opened wide, and flashing full upon me,-and such eyesl Heretofore I had only dreamed of snch. Age had not quenched their lightning, and I quailed beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me. But if I was, at first, surprised at the display of anger which I had called forth in him, how much more was I astonished to behold the whole expression of his countenance suddenly change. His eyes eontinued fixed upon mine as if I had bheen a basilisk. Apparently ho eonld not aert them; while his whole frame shiered with emotion. I adanced towards him; he shrank backwards, and, but for the timely aid of his companion, would hsve fallen upon the paeIment. At a loss to conceie in what way I could have occasioned him so much alarm, I rushed forward to the assistance of the old man, when his son, for such it subsequently auppeared he was, radely repelled me, and thrust his hand into his girdle, as if to seek for means to prevent further interference. Meanwhile the group had been inereased by the arrial of a third party, attracted by the cry the old man had uttered in falling. The new comer was an Italian gentleman, somewhat stricken in years; of stern and stately deportment, and with something rinister and forbidding in his A NIGRT' ADYENTURE I ROE. 221 aspect. Ho was hastening towards the old man, bat ha suddenly stopped, and was abont to retire when he encountered my gaze. As our eyes met he started; and a terror, as sudden and lisely as that'exhibited by the old man, was at once depicted in his features. My surprise was now beyond all bonnds, nnd I continuod for some moments speechless with astonislnent. Not a little of the inexplicable awe which affected the oll man and the stranger was communicated to myself. Altogether, we formed a mysterions and terrible triangle, of which ech side bore some strange and unintelligible relation to the other. The new comer first recovered his eomposure, though not without an effort. Coldly turning his heel upon me, he walked towards the old mnn, and shook him forcibly. The latter shrank from his grasp, and endeavoured to uoid him; but it was impossible. The stranger whisperel a few words in his ear, of which, from his gestures being directed towards myself, I oould guess the import. The old man replied. His action in doing so wass that of supplication and despair. The stranger retorted in a wild and vehement manner, and oeren stamped upon the ground; but the old man still eontinued to oling to the knees of his superior.

Addio, signor.'' And with hasty steps he quitted the church, accompanied by his son. Who is that old man 2'' I demanded of the priest. I am as ignorant as yourself,'' he replied, ``but h must be looked to; he talks threateningly'' And he beckoned to an attendant. e Who was he who struck him1' was my next inquiry. One of onr wealthiest nobles,'' he replied, `` and an assured friend of the church. We conld ill spare him.

Io was gone; none of the bystanders who had seen him go forth knew whither. Stung by curiosity, I wandered amid the most unfrequented quarters of Rome throughout the day, in the hope of meeting with the old Calabrian, but in vain.

In this I might hae been mistaken. No one answering to his description had been seen near the house. Une close tenbreuse fait par des hommas tenebrenx.-Lucnc BoeiA. Ox the same night I bent my steps towards tle Colosseum; and, full of my adventure of the morning, found nyself, not without apprehension, involed within its labyrinthine passages. Accompanied by a monk, who, with a small horn lantern in his hand, acted as my guide, I fanied that, by itas uneertain light, I could discover stealthy fgures lurking within the shades of the ruin. Whatever suspicions I might entertain, I pursued my course in silenee. Emerging from the vomitorio, we stood upon the steps of the colossal amphitheatre. The huge pilo was bathed in rosy moonlight, and reared itself in serene majesty before my view. While indulging in a thousand speculations, occasioned by the hour and the spot, I suddenly perceived a figure on a point of the ruin immediately above me. Nothing but tho head was visible; but that was placed in bold reliei 226 A NIGET' ADVEYTOE IN OE. against tho beaming sky of night, and I recognised it at once. No nobler Roman head had eer graced the circns when Rome was in her zenith. I shouted to the old Calabrian, for he it was I beheld. Almost ere the sound had left my lips, he had disappeared. I made known what I had seen to the monk. He was alarmed-urged our instant departure, and advised me to seek the assistance of tho sentinel stationed at the entrance to the pile. To this proposal I assented; and, having descended tho vasty steps and crorced the open arena, we arried, without molesta tion, at the doorway. The sentinel had allowed no one to pass him. He returned with me to the circus; and, after an ineffiectual search amongst tho ruins, olunteered his services to accompany me homewards throug the Forum. I declined his offer, and shaped my course tovards a lonesome vicolo on the right. This was courting danger; but lI cared nt, nnd walked lowly forward through the deserted place. Scarcely had I proceeded many paces, when I henrd footsteps swiftly approaching; and, ere I could tun round, my arms wero seizcd from behind, and a bandsge was passed across my eyes. All my efforts at liberation were unarsiling; and, after a brief struggle, I remained passive. MIakc no noise,'' said a oiee which I knew to be that of tho old man, ``and no harm shall befal you. Yon must come with us. Ask no qestions, but follow.'' I suffered myself to be led, without further opposition, L--- A MIGRT's ADYENTnE IN ROE. 227 whithersoever they listod. We walked for it might be half an honr, mnch beond the walls of Rome. I had to scramble through many ruins, and frequently stumbled oer inequalitics of ground. I now felt the fresh brecze of night blowing over the wide campagna, and my condactors moved swiftly onwards as we trod on its elastie turf. At length they came to a halt. My bandags was removed, and I beheld myself beneath the arch of an aqueduct, which spanned the moonlit plain. A fire was kindled beneath the arch, and the ruddy flame licked its walls. Aronnd the blaze were groped the little band of peasantry I had beheld within th church, in varions and picturesque attitudes. They greeted my conductors on their arrival, and glanced inquisitisely at me, but did not speak to me. The oller Calabrian, whom they addressed as Cristofano, asked for a glass of aqua vitr, which ho handed respeetfully to mc. I declined the offer, but he pressel it npon me. You will need it, signor,'' he said; `` yon hae mnch to lo to-night. You fear, perhaps, it is drgged. Behold1' And he drsnk it off. I conld not, after this, refuse his pledge. And now, signor,'' said the old man, remoing to a little distance from the group, ``'may I crave a word with yon-your name '"" As I had no reason for withholding it, I tcdl him how I was calloed.

Step nside, and lct us get within the shade of these arcehes, out of the reach of yonder listeners. The tale I hae to tell is for your ears alone.'' I obeyed him; and we stood beneath the shadow of the nqueduct. Years ago,'' began the old mn, ` an Englishman, in all respeets resembling yourself, equally well-favoured in person, and equally young, came to Rome, and took up his nbode within the eternal city. He was of high rank in his own country, and wns treated with the distinction due tu his exalted station here. At that time I dwelt with the MIarchese di-. I was his confidential serrant-his adviser-his friend. Ihad lived with his father-carried him ns an infant-sported with him as a boy-lored and served im as a man. Lovod him, I say; for, despite his treatment of me, I loved him then as much as I abhor him now. Welll signor, to my story. If his youth had been profligate, his manhood was not less depraed; it was devoted to eold, calculating libertinism. Soon after he sneceeded to the estates and title of lis father, hoe msrried. Thnt he A MaRs ADENTURE IN ROE. 229 loved his bride, I can scarcely believe; for, though he was wildly jealous of her, he was himself unfaithful, and she knew it. In Italy, reenge, in such cases, is easily within a woman's power; and, for anght I know, the marchesa might have meditated retaliation. My lord, however, took the alarm, and thought fit to retire to his villa without the city, and for a time remained seeluded within its walls. It was at tlis crisis that tha Englishman I have before mentioned arrived in Rome. My lady, who mingled little with the gaietios of the city, had not beheld him; but she eould not have been unacquainted with him by report, as every tongue was loud in his praises. A rumour of his suecesses with other dames had renched my lord; nay, I have reason to beliese that he had been thwarted by the handsome Englishman in some other quarter, and he sedulously prevented their meeting. An interiew, howeer, did take place betwveen them, and in an unexpected manner. It was the custom then, as now, upon particular occasions, to drive, during the heats of summer, within the Piazzs Navona, which is flooded with water. One evening tho marchesa droe thither: she was unattended, except by myself. Our carriage happened to be stationed near that of the young Englishman,'' The mnarchesa was beantiful, no doubt '' I said, interrapting him. MIost beantiful'' he replied; `' and so your countryman seemel to think, for he was lost in admiration of her. 230 A NIGIIT's ADENTURE IN OIE. I am not much ersed in the language of the eyes, bnt his wero too oloquent and expressive not to be understood. I watched my mistress narroly. It was eident from her glowing cheek, though her eyes were cast down, that she was not insensible to his regards. She turned to play with her dog, a lovely little greyhound, which was in the carriage beside her, anl pattel it carelessly with the glovo wlich she held in her hand. The animal snatched the glove from her grasp, and, as he bounded backwards, fell oer the carriage side. MIy lady uttered a scream at the sight, and I was preparing to extrieate the struggling dog, when tha Englishman plunged into the water. In an instant he had restored her favourito to the marchesa, and receied her warmest acknowledgments. From that noment an intimacy commenced, which was destined to produce the most fatal consequcneces to both parties.'' Did yon betray them 1'' I asked, somewhat impatiently. e I was then the blind tool of the marchese. I did so,'' repliel the old man. I told him all particulars of tho interviow. Ile henrd me in silence, bnt grew ashy palo with suppressed rage. Bidding me redouble my vigilanee, he left me. MIy laly was now scnrcely ever out of my sight; when one evening, a few days after what hsd occurred, she walked forth alone npon the garden-terrace of the villa. Her guitar was in her hand, and her favourite dog by her side. I was at a little distance, but wholly nnperceived. She struck a few plaintive chords upon her LLILLLLLLL A NIGIII's ADYENTUE IN ROYB. 231 instrument, and then, resting her chin npon her white and rounded arm, seemed lost in tendoer reerie. Wonld you had seen her, signor, as I beheld her then, or as one other bochold herl you would acknowledgoe that you had neve met with her oqual in beauty. Her raven hair fell in thick tresses oer shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most perfect proportion. Her deep dark eyes were thrown languidly on the ground, and her radiant features wero charged with an expression of profound and pensie passion. In this musing attitude she continued for some minutes, when she wss aroused by the gambolse of her dog, who bore in his mouth a glove which he had found. As she took it from him, a letter dropped upon the floor. Iad a serpent glided from its folds, it could not hae startled her more. She gazed upon the paper, offended, but irresolute. Yes, sho was irresolute; and you may conjecture the rest. Sho paused, and by that pause was lost. With a shrinking grasp she stooped to raiso the letter. Her cheeks, which had grown deathly pale, again kindled with blushes as she perused it. She hesitated-cast a bewildering look towarls the mansion-placed tho note within her bosom-and plunged into the orahge-bower.'' Hor loer awaited hoer there 7'"" He did. I saw them mcet. I heard his frenzied words --his passionate entreaties. He urged her to fly-she resisted. He grew more urgent-more impassioned. Sha nttered a faint cry, ahnd I stool before them. The English. 232 A MIGRTs ADYETURE IN ROME. man's hand was at my throat, and his sword at my breast, with the swiftness of thought; and but for the screams of my mistress, that instant must hae been my last. At her desiro he relinquished his hold of me; but her cries had reached other ears, and the marehese arried to aenge his injured honour. He paused not to inquire th nature of tho ofence, bat, sword in hand, assailed tho Englishman, bidding me remoe his Iady. The clash of their steel was drownel by er shrieks as I bore her awasy; but I knew tho strife was desperate. Before I gained the house my lady had finted; and, committing her to the charge of other attendants, I returned to the terrace. I met my master alowly walking homewards. His sword was gonehis brow was bent-he shunned my sight. I knew what had happened, and did not approach him. He songht his wifte. What passed in that interview was never disclosed, but it may be guessed at from its result. That night the marchesa left her hnsband's halls-never to return. Next morn I visited the terrace where she had receied tho token. The gloe was still upon the ground. I picked it up and carried it to the marchese, detailing the whole occurrence to him. He took it, and vowed as ho took it that his vengeance shonld never rest satisfied till that gloe had been steeped in her blood.'' And ho kept hias vow 1'' I asked, shnddering. MIany montls elapsed ere its accomplishment. Italian vengeance is slow, but sure.

Meanwhile, time rolled on, anl the marchesa gave birth to a child-the offspring cf her sedncer,'' Great GodI'' I exelaimed, '' was that child a boy t' It was-btdt listen to me. My tale draws to a close One night, dnring the absence of the Englishman, by seeret means we entered the palazzo where tho marchesa resided. We wandered from room to room till we came to her chamber. She was sleeping, with her infant by her side. The sight maddened the marchese. He would have stricken the child, bnt I held bck his hand. He relented. IIe bade me make fast the door. H approached the bol. I hcard a rustle-a scream. A white figure sprang from out the coueh. In an instant tho light was extinguishedthere was a blow-another-und all was oer. I thre open the door. The marchese came forth. The corridor in which we stood was flooded with moonlight. A glove was in his hand-it was dripping with blood. His osth wss fulfilled-his vengeance complete-no, not complete, for the Englishman yet lived,'' What became of him 7'' I inquired. t Ask me not,'' replied the old man; `' you were at th Chiesas Santa Maria Maggiore this morning. If those stones eould speask, they might tell a fearful story.'' And that was the reason yon did not dare to nnciose -- 234 A NIGHT's ApDvENURE n ROE. yonr eyes within those holy precinetsl-a film of blood floated between yon and heaven.'' The old man shuddered, but replied not. And the child?'"" I asked, after a pause;`"" what of their wretched offspring 7'' It was conveyed to England by a friend of its dead father. If he were alie, that boy wonld be about your age, signor.'' Indeed I'' I said; a horrible suspicion flashing aeross my mind. After the Englishman's death,'' continued Cristofano, ` my master began to treat me with a coldness and suspicion which increased daily. I was a burden to him, and he was resolved to rid himself of me. I sparod him the trouble-quitted Rome-sought the mountains of the Abruzzi-and thence wandered to the fastnesses of Calabria, and becme-no matter what. Iera I am, Heaven'a appointed minister of vengeance. The marchese dies tonight 1' To-night l old man,'' I echoed, horror-stricken. `'Add not crime to crime. If he as indeed been guilty of thaI fonl offence you have named, let him be dealt with aceording to the offended laws of the comntry. Do not pervert the purposes of justice.''

Yon saw how he was struck by your resemblance to the young Englishman this morning in the chiesa. It is wonderful1 I know not who or what you are; but to me you ara an instrument of vengeanee, and as such I shall use you. Tha blow dealt by you will seem the work of retribution; and I care not if you strike twice, and make my heart your second mark.'' Ere I conll reply he called to his comrades, and in a few moments we were speeding across the campagna. Wo arrived at a high wall : the old man conducted us to a postern-gate, which he opened. We entered s garden filled with orange-trees, the perfume of which loaded the midnight air. We heard the splash of a fountain at a distance, and the thrilling notes of a nightingale anongst some taller trees. The moon hung like a lamp over the belvidere of the proud villa. We strode along a wide terrce edged by a marble balustrade. The old man pointed to an open summer-house terminating the walk, and gave me a significant look, bnt he spoke not. A window thrown 236 A IGRs ADENTRE ROE. open admitted ns to the house. We were within a haIl orowded with statues, and traversed noiselessly its marble floors. Passing through seeral chambers, we then mounted to a corridor, and entered an apartment which formed the ante-room to another berond it, Placing his finger npon his lips, and making a sign to his comrades, Cristofana opened a door and disappeared. Thero was a breathless pause for a few minutes, during whieh I listened intently, but caught only a faint sound as of the snapping of a loek. Presently the old man retnrned. Ie sleeps,'' he said, in a low deep tone to me; ' sleeps as his victim slept-sleeps withont a dream of remorse; and he shall awaken, as she awoke, to despair. Come into his chamber t Woe obeyed. The door was made fast within side. The curtains of the couch were withdrawn, and the moonlight streamed full upon the face of the sleeper. He was hushed in profound reposo. No visions seemed to haunt his peaceful slumbers. Could guilt sleep so soundly1 I half donbted tho old man's story. Placing us within the shadow of the canopy, Cristofano approached the bed. A stiletto glittered in his hand. Awake l'' he cried, in a voice of thunder. The sleeper started at the summons. I watehed his countenance. He read Cristofano's errand in his eye. But he quailed not.

And who taught me the lesson 1'' fiercely interrupted the old msn. Am I the first that hae stolen on midnight slumber7 Gazo upon this7 When and how did it acquire its dye ?''

I was face to face with the marehese. The apparition of the murderod man could not have staggered him more. His limbs were stiffened by tho shoek, and he remained in an attitude of freezing terror. eIs he come for vengeance 7'' he ejaculated. He is' cried Cristofno. Givo him the weapon.' And a stiletto was thrast into my hand. Bat I heeded not the asteel.
