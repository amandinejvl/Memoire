TuE Sixteenth Century drew to a close. It was the lsst day of tho last year, and two hours anly were wanting to the birth of another year and of anothaor century. The night was solemn and beautiful. Myriads of sta@n pa@ed the deep vnult of hea@en; the crescent moon hung like a silver lamp in the milst of them; a stream of rosy and quivrering light@ issuing from the north@ trarersed th@ sky, like the tail of some stupendous co@et; whilo from its point of effluence broke forth, ever and anon, coruscations rivalling in splendour and variety of hue the most brilliant discharge of fireworks. A sharp frost pre@ailed; but the atmosphere was clear and dry, and neither wind nor snow aggra@ated the wholesome rigour of tho season. Tho water lay in thick congealed masses around the conduits and wells, and tho buekets weroe frozen on thcir stands. Tho thoronghfares ADRIOL. were sheeted with ice, and dangerous to horsemen and vehicles; but the footways were firm and pleasant to the tread. Hero and there, a fire was lighted in the streets, round which ragged urchins and mendicants were collocted, ronsting fragments of meat stuck upon iron prongs; or qunffing deep dra@ghts of metleglin and ale, out of lenathern cups@ Crowls were collected in the open places, watching the wonders in tha hea@ens, and drawing augurics from thcm, chiefly sinister, for most of the bcholders thought the signs portended the speely death of the queen, and the alvent of a new monarch from the north-a safo and easy interpretation, considering the ad@ancet age and declining health of the illustrious Elizabecth, togcther with the kno@n appointment of her successor, Jamcs of fScotland. Notwithstanding the early halits of the times, few persons had retired to rcst, an uni@ersal wish prevailing among thc citizens to see the ncew year in, and welcome the centnry nccompanying it. Lights glimmered in most windows, revealing the holly-sprigs and lanrel-lea@cs stuck thickly in thleir diamond panes; wlile, whenever as d@or wus opened, n ruddy gleam burst across the strcet; and a glance inside the dwelling showed its inmates either gathered round tho glowing hearth, oecupicd in mirthful sports-fox-i'-th@'hole, blind-nan's-buff, or shoe-the-marc-or seated at tho @mple board grouning with Christmas checr. MInsie nnd singing were henrd at e@ery coruer, and bnnds of com@ly damsels, escorted by their sweethearts, went Irom house to honse, bearing tage brown bowls dressed ---------------------DR. LAND. with ribands and rosemary, and filled with a drink called ``lamb's-wool,'' composed of sturdy ale, smeetenel with sugar, spiced with nutmeg, and ha@ing toasts and bur@t erabs floating within it,-a dranght from which seldom brought its pretty bcarers less than a groat, and occasionally a more valuable eoin. Such wns the @igil of thoe year Sixteen Hundred. On this night, and at the tenth hour, a man of striking and venerable appearanee wns sccn to emerge upon a small wooden balcony, projecting from a bay-window near the top of a picturesque structure situated at the southcrn extremity of London-bridge. The old man's bcard and @air were as white as snow@the former descending almost to his girdle; so were th@ thick@ o@erhanging brows thmt shaded lis still piercing eyes. His forehead was high, bald, and ploughed by innumerable @rinkles. IIis countenance, despito its dentl-lika pualeness, had a noble and nsjestic cnst, ani his figure, though worn to the bone by as life of the se@erest stnu@y, @nud bent by the woight of yenrs, must hase been once lofty and commauding. His dress consisted of n doublet and hose of sad-coloured cloth, over which he wore a loose govn of blaek silk. HIis head was co@ered by a square bluck cap, from @eneath whieh his silser locks strayed o@er his shoulders. Inown by the name of Doctor Lamb, and addieted to alchemicnl and philosophical pursuits, this vrenerable personage was esteemed by the vulgar as little better than a wizard. Strange tales were reported and believed of him. n 2 3ADRIoO. Mmongst others, it was said that he possessed a familiar, because he chanced to employ a deformod, eraek-brained dwarf, who assisted him in his operations, and wlom he app@opriately enongh denominated Flapdragon. Doctor Lamb's gaze was fixed iutently upon the hea@ens, nnd he seemed to be notiug the position of the moon with referencoe to some particular star. Mfter remaining in t@is posture for a few minutes, he was about to retire, when a loud crash arrested him, and he turned to see whence it proceeded. Immeliately before him stood the Southwark Gate@ay@a equare stons building, with a ronnd, embattlod turret at enach corner, and a flat, leaden roof, planted with a forest of poles, fifteen or sixteen feet high, garnished with human henls. To his surprise, the doctor percei@ed thnt two of these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man, who was in the act of stripping th@n of their grisly burdens. Having accomplished his olject, the mysterious plunlerer thrust his spoil into a leathern bag with @hich he was provided, tied its mouth, and was about to take his departur@ by means of a rope-ladder attached to the battlements, when his retreat was suldenly cut off by the gutekeeper, armed with a halberd, and bearing a lantern, @ho issued from a door opening upon the lcads. The baffled marauder looked round, and remarking the open winlow at which bDoctor Lnmb was stationed, hurledl the sacek and its contents tlrough it. IIo then triodl to gain the ladder, but was intercepted by the gntckceper, who dealt him n s@vere blow on the head with his halberd. DR. LAMIB. Tho plunderer uttered a loud cry, and attempted to draw his sword; but before he could do so, hoe received a thrust in the side from his opponent. Ho thon fell, and the gatekeeper wonld hare repeated the blow, if tho doctor had not called to him to desist. @Do not kill him, good Baldred,'' he eried. @Th@ attempt may not be so criminal as it appears. Doubtless, the mntilatel remains which tho poor wretch has attempted to cnrry off, are those of his kindred, and horror at their exposure must have led him to commit tho offence.'' @It may be, doetor,'' replied Baldred; `` and if so I shall bo sorry I hare hurt him. Bnut I am responsible for tho snfe custody of tlese traitorous relics, and it is as much as my own hend is worth to permit their remo@al.'' @I know it,'' replied Doctor Lamb; ``and you are fully justified in what you have done. It may throw some light npon the matter, to know whose miserable remains ha@@ been disturbel.'' @They were tho heads of two rank papists,'' replied Bualdred, @who were deeapitatel on @ower Hill, on Saint Nicholas's day, three weeks ago, for conspiring against tha qucen.'' e But their names?'' demanded the doctor. @How were they called 7'' @They wero father and son,'' replied Baldred ;-: Sir Simon Darey and Master Reginald Darey. Perchan@ea t@ey were known to your worship 7'' e Too well-too well 1'' repliel Doctor Lamb, in a voice of emotion, that startled his hcarcr. @They were near l---AIoI. kinsmen of mine@own. Wh@t is he lilo wlo has mado tlis strange attempt '' @Of a rerity, a fair youth,'' rcplie1 Daldrcd, lolding down the lantern. @Iea@en grant I la@o not wounded @im to the death1 No, his heart still bcats. IIa1 hera ar@ his tablets,'' ho adled, taking a small book from his loublet; `' these may gi@e tho information you seek. Yon wero right in your conjccture, doctor. Tho namo herein inscribed is the same as that torne by tho others-Auriol Darey.'' @I sce it all,'' cried Lamb. @It was a pious and praiseworthy deed. DBring the unfortunate youth to my dwelling, Daldred, and you shall be well rcwardel. Use despatch, I pray you.'' As the gatekceper essayed to co@ply, the wonnded man groanel deeply, as if in great pain. @Fling me the wcapon with which you smoto lim,'' ericd Doctor Lamb, in accents of commiseration, `'`and I @ill anoint it @ith the powder of sympathy. IIis anguish @ill be spcelily abated.'' eI k@ow your worship can accomplish @onlers,'' oried @aldred, tlrowing the halberd into the baleony. @I @ill do my part as gently as I can.'' And as tle alclemnist taok up the weapon, and disappeared thirough the window, the gatekceper liftel tho wounded man by t@e shoulders, and conveyed him down a narrow@ winding staircase to a lower chambcr. Though ho procced@d carefully, the sufferer was put to excraciating pain; nnl when Daldred placed him en a wooden bench, and held DB. LAMD. a lsmp towards him, he percei@ed that his features wera darkened and distorted. @I fenr it's all over with lim,'' mnrmured the gatekeeper; eI @hall ha@e a dead body to take to Doctor Lamb. It wonld bo a charity to knoek him on the head, rather th@n let him suffer thus. Tho doctor passes for a cunning ma@, but if he cnn cure this poor youth without sceing him, by tho help of his sympathetic ointment, I shall begin to believe, what some folks a@ouch, that he has relations with the levil.' Whilo Baldred was rnminating in this manner, a sndden and cxtraorlinary change took place in tho suflerer. As if by mngic, the contraction of tho muscles subsided; the features assumed n wholesome hue, and the rcspiration was no longer laborious. Daldred stared as if a miracle had been wronght. Now that the countenance of tho yonth had regained its original expression, the gatekeeper could not help being struek hy its extreme beanty. The fuce was a pcrfect o@al, with regular and delicate featurces. A short silken moustache covered the uppcr lip, which was short and pr@ul, and a pointedl bearl terminated the chin. The hair was blacl, glossy, and cut short, so as to lisclose a highly intellectnal cxpanse of brow. Tho youtl's figure was slight, but atmirably proportioned. His attire consisted of a blaek satin doublet, slashed with white, hose of black silk, and a slort vel@et mantle. His eyes were still closed, and it was difficult to say what effect they might gi@e to the face when they lighted it np; but AU10L. notwithstanding its beauty, it was impossible not to admit that a strange, sinister, and almost demoniacal expression per@aded the conntenance. All at once, and with nas much suddenness as his cure had bcen effected, the young man started, uttering a pierciug ery, and placed his hand to his sido. @C@iti@f1' he cried, fixing his blazing eyes on the gatekeeper, `` why do you torture me thus? Finish me at onco -Oh@' And overeome by anguish, he sank back again. @I hasve not touched yon, sir,'' replied Baldred. e1 brought you here to succour you. You will be easier anon. Doctor L@mb must have wiped the hallerd,'' he added to limself. Another sudden change. Tho pain @led from the sufferer's countenance, and he became easy ae before. @What ha@o you done to me1'' ho asked, with a look of gratitudo; ` tlo torture of my wound has suddenly ceased, and I feel ass if a bnlm had been dropped into it. Let me remain in this state if you have any pity-or despatch me, for my late ngony was almost insupportable,'' @You are cnred for by one who hns greater skill than any chirurgeon in London,'' replied Buldred. @If I cnn manage to transport you to his lodgings, he will speelily heal your wounds.'' e Do not delay, then,'' repliel A@riol, fsintly; @fo@ though I am free from pain, I feel that my life is ebbing fast away.'' e Press this hnndkerchief to your side, nnd lean on mo,'' DB. LAMD. said Buldred. @Doctor Lamb's dwelling is but a step from the gateway-in fact, the first house on the bridge. By tho wuy, the doctor declares he is your kinsman,'' @It is the first I ever heard of lim,' replied Auriol, fuintly; "but take me to him quickly, or it will bo too late'' In another moment they were at the doetor's door. Baldred tapped against it, and tho summons was instantly a@swered by a diminutive personage, clad in a jerkin of coarse grey serge, and having a leathern apron ticd round his waist. This was Flapdragon. Blear-eyed, smoke- begrimel, lantern-javed, the poor dwarf seemed as if his whole life had been spent over the furnace. And so, in fact, it had been. He had become little better than a pair of human bellows. In his hand he hcld the halberd with which Auriol had been wounded. @So you ha@e been plasying the lcech, Flapdragon, eh7'' cried Baldred. @Ay, marry laro I,'' replied the dwarl, with a wild grin, @nd displaying na wolfish set of teeth. ' My master ordered me to smear the halberd with the sympathetic oiutment. I obeyed him; rubbed the steel point, first on one side, then on the other; next wiped it; and then smearedl it again.'' @Whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain,'' replied Baldred; ` but help me to transport him to the laboratory.'' eI know not if thoe doctor will care to be disturbod,'' said Flapdragon. @Ho is busily engaged on a grand operation.'' @I will tako the risk on myself,'' said Baldred. @Tha 10 AB:OL. youth @ill die if le remains here. Sce, he las fainted alrealy I'' Thus urged, the dwarf laid down tho halberd, and botween the t@o, Aunriol was speedily conveyed up a wide oaken staircase to the laboratory. Doctor Lamb was plying the bellows at tha furnace, on wlich a large alembic was placel, and he was so engrossel by his task, that le scnrccly noticed the entrance of the others. @@laeoe the youth on the ground, and rear his head ag@inst the chair,'' he eried, hastily, to thoe dwarf. @Batha his brows with the decoction in that crucible. I will attend to him anon. Come to me on the morrow, Ballred, and I @ill repay thee for thy trouble. I am busy now.'' @Theso relics, doctor,'' criedi the gatekee@er, glancing at the bag, which was lying on the ground, and from wiich a bald head protruded@-I ought to take them back with me.'' IIeed them not-they will be snfe in my kceping,'' cried Doctor Lamb, impaticntly; `` to-morrow-to-morrow.'' Casting a furtire glance round the laboratory, anl shrugging his slonllers, Baldrel departed; and FInpdragon la@ing bathed tho sufferer's temples with the decoction, in obelience to his mastcr's injunctions, turned to inquirs wh@t he should do next. @Degonel'' cried the doctor, so fioreoel@ that tho dwarf darted out of the room, clapping tha door after him. Doctor Lamb then applied himsolf to his task with reneved ardour, and in a few seconds became wlolly inscnsible of the presence of a stranger. n. AD. Revi@ed by the stimulant, Anriol presently opened his eyes, and gazing round the room, tlought he must be dreaming, so strange and fantastical did all appear. The floor was co@ered with the implements nsed by the adept@bolt-heads, crucibles, cucnrbites, and retorts, scattered abont without any attempt at arrangement. In one corner was a large terrestrial sphere; near it was an astrolabe; and nenar that a heap of disused glass @essels. On the other sile, lay s black, mysterions-looking book, fastened with brazen clasps. Aro@nd it, were as ram's horn, a pair of forceps, a roll of parchment, a pestle anl mortar, and a large plato of copper, gra@en with the mysterious s@mbols of the Isaicnl table. Nenr this was the leathern bag containing the two decapitated heals, one of which hal burst forth. On a table, at the farther end of tle room, stood n large open volume, with parchment leaves, covered with cabalistical characters, refcrring to the names of spirits. Ncnar it were two parchment scrolls, wvritten in letters, respectively denominated by the Challaie sages, '` the Malachim,'' and ` the Passing of the River.'' One of these scrolls was kept in its plaee by a skull. An ancient and grotesquc-looking brass lamp, with two snake-healed burners, lighted th@ room. From the @eciling depended a huge scaly sea-monster, with outspreal fins, open jaws, garnishel with tremendous teeth, and great goggling eyes. Near it hung a celestial sphere. The chimney-piece, which was curiously car@ed, and projected far inlo the room, mas laden with various implements of Hermetie science. Abo@e it were hung dried bats and flitter-mice, interspersed with the sk@lls of birds AUHIOL. and apes. Attached to the chimney-piece was a horary, sculptured in stone, near which hung a large stsr-fish. Tua fireplace was oceupied by thoe furnace, on which, as has been stated, was placed an alembic, communicating by means of a long serpentine pipe with a recei@er. Within the room were two skeletons, one of which, placed behind a curtain in the deep embrasure of the window, where its polished bones glistened in the whito moonlight, had a horriblo effect. The other enjoyed more comfortalle quarters near the chimney, its @leshless feet dangling down in the smoka arising from the furnace. Doctor Lamb, meanwhile, steadily pursned his task, though he ever and anon paused, to fling certain roots and drugs upon the clarcoal. As he did this, various-coloured flames broke forth-now blue, now green, now blood-red. Tiuged by these fires, the diflerent objects in the chamber seemed to take othoer forms, and to become instinct with animation. The gourd-shaped cucnurbites wero transformed into great bloated tonds bursting with venom; tle long@necked bolt-heade became monstrous serpents; the worm@like pipes turned into adders; the alembics looked like plumed helmets; the characters on the Isaical table, and those on the parchments, scemel traced in fire, and to be over changing; the s@a-monster bellowed and roarced, and, flapping his fins, tried to burst irom lis look; the skeletons wagged their ja@s, and raised their fleshless fingers in mockery, while blue lights burnt in their eyeless soekets; the bellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with DnB. LAB. 13 its wings; and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of the arch-fiend presiding over a witcles' sabbath. Auriol's brain reeled, and he pressed his hand to his eyes, to exclude these phantasms from his sight. But even thus they pursued him; and he imagired hoe could hear the infernal riot going on around him. Suddenly, he was roused by a loud joyful cry, and, uncovering his eyes, he behoeld Doctor Lamb pouring the contecnts of the matrass-a bright, transparent liquid-into a small phial. Having carefully secured the bottlo with a glass stopper, the old man held it towards the light, and gazed at it with rapture. `At length,'' he exclaimed aloud-'` at length, the great work is achie@ed. With the birth of tle centary now expiring I first sasw light, and the draught I hold in my hand shiall enable me to see the opening of centuries and centuries to co@e. Composed of the lunar stones, the solar stones, and the mercurial stones-preparetd according to the instructions of the Ruabbi Ben Lucca,-namely, by the separation of the pure from the impure, the volatilisation of the fixed, and the fixing of the @olatile; this elixir shall renew my youth, like that of the eagle, and give me length of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed.'' Whils thns speaking, he held up the sparkling liquid, and gazed at it like a Persian worshipping the sun. @To live for e@er1'' he cried, after a pause-`` to escape the jaws of death just when they are opening to de@our me 1-to he free from all aecidents 1-'tis a glorious 14 AIIOL. thought1 Ia1 I bethink me, the rabbi said there was one peril against whieh the elixir could not guard me-@one vulnerable point, by which, like the heel of Achilles, death might reach me1 What is i 1-where can it lie7'' And he relapsed into deep thought. IThis uncertainty will poison all my happiness,'' he continued; ` I shall li@e in constant dread, as of an invisible enemy. Dut no matterl Perpetunl lifo l-perpetual youth 1-what more ueed be desiroed 7'' @Wwhat more, indeed 1'' cried Auriol. @Ha1'' cxelaimed the doctor, suddenly recollecting the wounded man, and concealing tle phial beneath his go@n. e Yonr caution is vnin, doctor,'' snid Auriol. @I have heard whnt you havo uttered. You faney you lave discovered the olixir vit@@.'' e Fancy I have discorered it1' eried Doetor Lamb. @The matter is past all doubt. I am the possessor of thc wondrons secret, which the greatest plilosophers of all ages ha@e songht to discover--the miraculous preser@utive of tho boly against deeay.'' @The man who brought me hither told me yon were my kiusman,'' said Auriol. @Is it so t'' @It is,'' re@lied the doctor, '` and you shall now learn the co@ne@xion that subsists between us. Look at that ghastly relic,'' he added, pointing to the head protruding from the bag, " that was onco my son fSimon. His son's hend is within the sack-yonr futher's head-so that four genemations are brought together.'' @Gracious Heaven'' exclaimed the yonng man, raising DR. LAB. 15 himself on his elbon. @Yon, then, are my great-grandsire. My futher supposed you had died in his infancy. An old tale runs in the family that you were charged with sorcery, and fled to avoid the stake.'' e It is true that I fled, and took the name I bear at present,'' replied the old mnn, ``bnt I need scarcely sasy that tho charge brought against me was false. I ha@e dovoted myself to abstrusest science; ha@e held commune with tho stars; and have wrested the most hidden seerets from Nature-but that is all. T@o crimes alone have stained my soul, but both, I trust, ha@e been expiated by repentance.'' @Were they deeds of @loodt'' asked Auriol. @One was so,'' replied Darey, with a shudder. 'It was a cowardly and trcacherous deed, aggravated by the basest ingratitule. Listen, nnd yon shall hear low it chuanced. A Roman rabbi, named Ben Luccn, skilled in Hermetic science, came to this city. His fame reached me, and I sought him out, offering myself as his disciple. Ror montls, I remained with him in his laboratory-working at the furn@ee, aud poring over mystic lore. One night, he showel me that @olume, and, poiuting to a page within it, said: @Those characters contain the secret of confecting the elixir of Iife. I will now explain tlem to yon, and afterwards we will proceed to the operation.' Witl this, he unfolded the myster@; but he bade @e observe, that the menstrunm was defective on one point. Wherefore, he suid, `there will ,still be peril from some hidden canse.' Oh, with wlat greediness I drank in his words1 How lI gazed 16 AURIO. at the mystio characters, as he explained theire import@ What @isions floated beforo me of perpetnal yontl and ene joymcnt. At that moment a demon whispered in my ear, -- This secret must be thine own. No one elso must possess it.@@ @HIa1'' exclaimed Auriol, starting. @The e@il thought was no sooner concei@ed than acted upon,'' pursued Darey. ` Instantly drawing my poniard, I plunged it to the rabbi's @cart. Dut mark vhat followed. IIis blood fell upon the book, and obliternted tho characters; nor could I by any effort of memory reca@l the composition of the elixir.'' @When did you regain the secret 2'' asked Auriol, cnriously. @To-night,'' replied Darcy-`` within this hour. @or nigh fifty years after that fatal night I haso been making fruitlcss experiments. A film of blood has obscured my mnental sight. I have proceedel by calcitration, solution, putrefaction-ha@e produced the oils whiech will fix crudo mucrcuiry, and convert uall bodies into sol and luna; but I have over failed in fermenting the stono into the truo elixir. @1-night, it came into my hend to wash the @lood-stained @y:c coutaining the secret with a subtle liquid. I did so; @ul loubting thc efficacy of the experi@ent, left it to work, @hilo I went forth to breathe the air at my window. My eyes were cnst upwnrds, and I wss struck with the malignant aspect of my star. How to reconcile this with the geod fortune which hass just befallen me, I know not-bnt so it was. At this juncture, your rash, but pious attempt DR. LAB. occurred. Having discovered our relationship, and enjoined the gatekeeper to bring yon hither, I returmaed to my old laboratory. On glancing towards the mystic volame, what was my surprise to see the page free from blood 1' Auriol uttered a slight exclamation, and gazed at the book with superstitious awe. IThe sight was so surprising, that I dropped tle sack I @ad brought with me,'' pursued Darey. @Fearful of again losing the secret, I nerved mysolf to the task, and placing fuel on the fire, dismissed my attendunt with brief injunctions relati@e to you. I then set to work. IHow I ha@e succeeded, you percei@e. I hold in my hand tho treasure I have so long sought-so eagerly coveted. ITho whole world'a wealth shonld not purchase it from me.'' Auriol gazed earnestly at his aged relative, but he said nothing. t In a few moments I shall be as full of rigour and aetivity as yourself,'' continued Darey. s We shall be no longer the great-grandsire and his descendant, but friends --companions-equals,-equals in age, strength, activity, beauty, fortune-for youth is fortnne-hal ha1 Methinks I am already yonng sgain l'' @Yon spoke of two crimes with which yonr ceonscicnee was burdened,'' remarked Auriol. @You have mentioned ]but one.'' @The other was not so foul as that I havo described,'' ]replied Darcy, in an altered tone, `` inasmuch as it wss unintentional, and oeeasioned by no base moti@e. My wife, your ancestress, was a most lovely woman, and so passion ARIOL. ately wae I enamonred of her, that I tried by every art to heighten and preserve her beauty. I fed her upon the flosh of capons, nourished with vipers; cansed her to steep her lo@ely limbs in baths distilled from roscs and violets; and hnd recourse to the most potent cosmcties. At last I preparel a draught from poisons-yes, poisons@-the effect of which@ I imagined@ would be wondrous. She drank it, andl expired horribly disfigured.

Try a few drops of it on somo animal.'' e No-no; it is tho true elixir,'' replied Darey. @Not a drop must be wasted. You will witncss its effect anon. Like the snake, I shnll cast my slough, and come forth younger than I was at twenty.'' @MIenantime, I bescech yon to render me somo assistance,'' groaned Auriol, @or, while you are preparing for immortality, I shall expire beforo your eyes.'' @Be not afraid,'' replicd Darey; `yon shall take no harm. I will care for you presently; and I understand --DR.

For a moment he was bewildered as with wine, and laughed and sang discordantly like a madman. Every object reeled and danced around him.

L@rE one night, in the spring of 1880, two men issued .from a low, obsenrely-situated public-house, near Iiillbank, and ahaped their course apparently in the direction of Vauxhall-bridge. A@oiding the footpath near the river, they movel stealthily along toe farther sile of the road, wrhere thue opcn groun@ offerei them au easy reans of flight, in case such a course should bo found expedient. So fur as it could he disccrnol by the glimpses of the moon, which @ecasionally shone forth from a raek of hea@y clonds, the a@pearancee of these personages was not mnucl in their fa@our. IIaggard fcatures, stamped deeply with the characterse of crime and , debauehery; fierce, restless eyes; beards of several days' growth; wild, unkempt hesds of hair, formod their chief personal charaeteristics; whilo sordid and ragged clothes; shoes without soles; and old hats withiont crown@, -.nstitated the sum of their apparel, ARIOL. One of them was tall and gaunt, with large hands and foet; but despite his meagreness, he eridently possessed great strength: the other was considerably shorter, but broad-shouldered, bow-legged, long-armed, and altogether n most formidable ruffian. This fellow had high cheek@bones, a long aquiline nose, and a coarse mouth and chin, in which the animal greatly predominated. He had@a stubby red beard, with sandy hair, white brows and eyelashes. The oountenance of the other was dark and repulsive, and covered with blotches, the result of habitual intemperance. His eyes had s leering and malignant look. A. handkcerchief spotted with blood, and tied across his brow, contrasted strongly with his matted black hair, and incrensed his natural appearanc@ of ferocity. Tho shorter r@ffian carried a mallet upon his sho@lder, and his companion concealed something beneath the breast of his cost, which nfterwards proved to be a dark lantern. Not a word passed between them; but keeping a vigilant look-out, they trudged on with quick, shambling steps. A few sounds arose from the banks of the river, and there was no@ and then a plash in the water, or a distant cry, betokening some passing craft; but generally all was profonndly still. The quaint, Dutch-looking structures on the opposite bank, the line of coal-barges and lighters @oored to the strand, the great timber-yards and coal-yards, the brewhouses, gasworks, and waterworks, could only bo imperfectly discerned; but the moonlight fell clear upon th@ ancient towers of Lambeth Palace, and on the neighbouring ch@r@h. Ihe same glimmer aleo ran like a silver bel TEIE BUAED RODBE IN TIE YAUXRALL-oAD. 25] across the stream, and re@ealed the great, stern, fortress@lIike pile of the Penitentiary-perhaps the most dismal@looking structure in tho whole metropolis. The world of habitations beyond this melancholy prison were buried in larkness. The two men, however, tlought nothing of these things, and saw nothing of them; but, on arri@ing within a couple of hundred yards of the bridge, suddenly, as if by previous concert, quitted the road, and, leaping a rail, ran across a field, and plunged into a hollow formed by a dried pit, where they came to a momentary hualt. @You ain't a-been a-gammonin' me in this matter, Tinker 2' observed the shorter individual. ss The co@e'as sure to come f' @Why, you can't expect me to answer for anothoer as I can for myself, Sandman,'' replied the other; ' but if his own word's to be taken for it, he's sartin to be there.

" So come along, and don't let's bo frightenin' ourselves vith ould vimen's tales.'' With tlis they emerged from tle pit, crossed the lower part of thoe field, and entered a narrow thoroughfare, skirted by a few detached houses, wlich brought them iuto tho Vauxhall-bridge-road. Here thcy kept on the side of the street most in shadow, and crosscd o@cr whcne@er they came to a lamp. By-nnd@by, two watclmen were seen ad@ancing from Belvoir-terrace, and, as the guardians of the niglt drew near, the ruflians crept into nn nlley to let t@lc pass. As soon as the coast was clcar, they ventured forth, and quickening their pnce, cnme to a row of deserted and dilapidated houscs. T@is was their destination.

These neglected dwellings served as receptacles for old iron, blocks of stone and wood, and other ponderous matters. The aspect of the whole place was so dismal and suspicious, that it was generally a@oided by passengers after nightfiall. Bkulking along the blank and dresry walls, the Tinker, who was now a little in advance, stopped hefore a door, and pushing it open, entered the dwelling. His companion followed him. Tle extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects which met the gaze of tho Sandman, coupled with the deserted appearanco of the plsce, produced an effeet upon his hardy but superstitious nature. Looking round, he beheld hnge mill-stones, enormous water-wheels, boilers of steam-engines, iron vatse, eylinders, cranes, iron pumps of the strangest fashion, a gigantie pair of wooden scales, old iron safes, old boilers, old gas-pipes, old water-pipes, cracked old bells, old bird@csges, old plates of iron, old pnlleys, ropes, and rusty chains, hnddled and heaped together in the most fantsstie disorder. In the . midst of the chaotic mass frowned the bearded and colossal head of Neptune, whieh had onee deeorated the forepart of a man-of-war. Above it, on a sort of framework, lay th@@@@@@@@a@@ @@@the@@@@@ n@@@@@@@o@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@s@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@o@e of the latter being partly demolished, and the eyes knocked in. Ab@ee these, three garden divrinities laid their heads amieably together. On the left stood a tall Grecian warrior, minns the head and right hand. The whole was surmounted by an immense @entilator, stuck on the end of ARIoL. an iron rod, ascending, like a lightning-conductor, from tha steam-engine pump. Seen by the transient light of the moon, the various objects above enumerated produced a strange effect upon the beholler's imagination. There was a mixture of the grotesque and terribloe abont them. Nor was the building itself de@oid of a certain influence npon his mind. Tho ragged brickwork, overgrown with weeds, took with him the sema blance of a human face, and seemoed to keep a wary eye on what was going forward below. A means of crossing from one side of the bnilding to tha other, without descending into the vault beneath, was afforded by s couple of plsnks; though as the wall on the farther side was some feet higher than that near at hand, and tho planks were considerably bent, the passage appeared hazardous. Glancing round for a moment, tha Tinker leaped inta the cellar, and, unmasking his lantern, showed a sort of hiding-place, between a bulk of timber and a boilor, to which he invited his companion. The Sandman jumped down. @Ihe ale I drank at the IT@o Fighting Cocks' has made me feel drawsy, Tinker,'' he remarked, stretching himsolf on the bulk; @I@l1 just take a snooze.

Slightly altering his position, the Sandman caught sight of a figure standing upon the planks above them. It was] that of s young man. His hat was off, and his features, exposed to the full radiance of the moon, looked denthly pale, and though handsome, had a strange sinister expression. He was tall, slight, and well-proportioned; and the general cnt of his attire, the tightly-bnttoned, single-breasted coat, together with the moustache upon his lip, gave him@a military sir. @He seems a-valkin' in his sleep,'' mnttered the Sandman. @He's a-speakin' to some von unwisible.'' @Hush-hushl'' whispered the other.

Making a sign to the Sandman, who was elose at his hecols, the Tinker crept forward on all fonrs, and, on reaching the window, raised himself just sufficiently to command the interior of tha dwelling. Unfortunately for him, the moon was at this moment obscured, and he conld distinguish nothing- except the dnsky ontline of tho varions oljects with which the place was filled, and which were@nearly of the samo kind as those of the neighbouring habitation.

MAfter some time spent in tlis way, he began to fear the young man must have departed, when all at once a piercing scream resounded thro@gh the dwelling.

Without waiting for another salute of the sasme kind, which might possibly be nearer its mark, the ruffian kicked the lantern into the vault, and sprang aftcr th@ Sandman, who had already disappeared. Acquainted with the intricacies of the place, the Tinker guided his companion through a hole into an adjoining rault, whenee they scaled a wall, got into the next house, and passing through an open window, made good their retreat, while the watchmen were vainly searching for them under every bulk and piece of iron. % Here, watclmen ?'' eried tho stout indi@idual, who had acted as leader; ``never mind tho villains just now, but help me to convey this poor young gentleman to my house, where proper assistance can be rendored him.

With this, he snatched the bottle of brandy from the maid, filled a wine-glass with the spirit, and pourel it down tho throat of the wounded man.

Entering a narrow street, guarded by posts and cross@bars, n few steps from the crowded thoroughfare brought yon into a frigltful region, the refuge, it was easy to percei@e, of half th@ lawless characters infesting the metropolis.

There was something suvagely pictures@ue in the aspect of tho place, but its fecatares were too loathsome to be regarded with any other feeling than disg@st. Tha honses looked as sordid, and as tlickly crusted with the lcprosy of vice, as their tenants. Ho@rible habitations tley were, in trath. MIany of then were withont windows, and whero the frames were left, brown paper or tin supplied the place of glass; some even wanted loors, and no offort was nade to conceal the squalor within. On the contrary, it seemed to bo intruded on observation. Miserable rooms, almost destitute of furniture; floors and walls cuked with dirt, or decked with coarse flaring prints; shameless and abandoned-looking women; children withont shoes and stockings, and with scarcely a rag to thcir backs: these were the c@ief objects that mct the @icw. Of men, few were @isible-the majority being out on business, it is to be presumed; but where a solitary straggler was seen, @is sinister looks and mean attire were in perfeet keeping with the spot. So tlickly inhabited were these wretched dsellings, that e@cry chamber, irom gurret to ccllar, swar@ed with inmates. As to the cellars, they looked like dismal caverns, which a wild be@st would shun. Clothes@lines wero hung from houso to louse, festooned with every kind of garment. Out of the main strcet branched several allcys and passages, all displaying the same degree of misery, or, if possible, worse, and teeming with occupants. Tersonal security, ho@ever, forbade any attempt to track p 2 7-36 ARIOL. these labyrinths; but imagination, after the specimen afforded, could easily picture them. It was impossible to mo@e a step withont insult or annoyance. Every human being seened brutalised and degraded; and the women appeared utterly lost to decency, and made the street ring with their cries, their quarrels, and their imprecations. It was a positire relief to escape from this hotbed of crime to the world without, and breathe a purer atmosphere. Such being the aspect of the Rookery in the dasytime, what must it hare been when crowded with its denizens at night1 Yet at such an hour it will now be necessary to enter its penetralia. After escaping @@om the ruined honso in the Vauxhall@road, the two ruffians shaped their course towards Saint Giles's, running the greater part of the way, and reacuing the Bro@dway just as the church clock struck two. Darting into a narrow alley, and heedless of any obstructions they encountered in their path, they entered a somewhat wider cross-street, which they pursued for a short distance, and thoen struck into an entry, at the bottom of which w@s a swing door that admitted them into a small court, where they found a dwarfish person wrapped in a tattered watchman's great-coat, seated on a stool with a horn lantern in his hand and a cutty in his mouth, the glow of which lighted up his hard, withered features. This was the deputy-porter of the lodging-house they were about to enter, Addressing him by the name of Ol@ Parr, the ruffians passed on, and lifting the latch of another door, TEE DOG-FANCIER. 87 entered a sort of kitehen, at the farther end of @hich blazed a cheerfnl fire, with as largo copper kettle boiling upon it. On one side of the room was a deal table, round which seseral men of sinister aspect and sordid attire were eollected, playing@ at cards. A smaller table of the same material stood near the fire, and opposite it was a staircase leading to tho upper rooms. The place was dingy and dirty in the extreme, the floors could not havoe been scoured for years, and the walls were begrimed with filth. In ono corner, with his head resting on a heap of coals and coke, lay a boy almost as black as a chimney-sweep, fast asleep. Ho was the waiter. The prineipal light was afforded by a candle stuck against tho wall, with as tin reflector behind it. Before the fire, with his back turned towards it, stood a notieeable individual, elad in a velveteen jacket, with ivory bnttons, a striped waistcoat, drab knees, s falod black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow, and a pair of ancient Wellingtons asceending half-way up his legs, which looked disproportionately thin when comparel with the upper part of his sqnare, robustious, and somewhat pursy framo. His face was broad, jolly, and good@humoured, with a bottle-shaped nose, fleshy lips, and light grey eyes, glistening with cunning and roguery. His hair, which dangled in long flakes over his ears and neck, was of a dunnish red, ass were also his whiskers and benrd. A superannuated white castor, with a black hat@band round it, was cocked knowingly on one sido of his head, and gavo him a flashy and sporting look. His particular @ocntion was 38 AnIoL. made manifest by the numiber of dogs he had abont him. A benntiful black-and-tan spaniel, of Charles thoe Second's breed, popped its short @@ubby nose and long silken enrs ont of each coat-pocket. A png was thrust into his breast, and he carried an exquisite Blenheim under cither arm. At his feet reposed an Isle of Sk@e terrier, and a partly-cropped French poodle, of sno@y whiteness, with a red worsted riband ronnd his throat. This person, it need scarcely be said, was a dog-fancier, or, in other words, a denler in, nnd a stenler of, dogs, as well as a praetiser of all the trieks connected with that nefarions trade. His self-satisfied air mnde it evident he thought himself a smart@ cle@er fellow, -and adroit and kn@sish he was, no doubt,--while his droll, plausible, and rather winning manners, helped him materially to impose upon his customers. His real name wns Taylor, bnt he was known among his companions by the appellation of Ginger.

II. A vnr@o@s barking from Mr. Ginger's dogs, shortly after the departure of the drowsy youth, anuounced tho npproach of a grotesque-looking littlo personage, whose sloulders barely reached to a level with the top of the table. IThis was Old Parr. The dwarf's @ead was much too large for his body, as is mostly the caso with undersized persons, and was covered with a forest of rusty black hair, protected by a strangely-shapel seal-skin eap. His hands and feet were equally disproportionedt to his frame, and his arms wero so long that he could tonch his ankles while standing upright. His spine was crookened, and his head appeared buriod in his breast. The general character of his face seemed to appertain to the middle period of life; but a closer inspection enabled tho beholder to detect in it marks of extremo old age. The nose was broad and flat, likce that of an ourang-outang; the resemblance to which animal wss heightened by a very long @pper lip, projecting ja@s, almost total absence of chin, and a retreating forehead. The littlo old man's complexion was dull and swarthy, but his eyes were keen and sparkling. His uttire was as singular as his person. Ha@ing recently served as doubloe to a famous demon-dwarf at the Bnrrey Theatre, he hal become possessed of a cast-off pair --------50 AURIOL. of tawny tights, an elastic shirt of the same material and complexion, to thoe arms of which little green bat-like wings were attache@, while a blood-red tunie with vandykc points was girdcl round his waist. In this strange apparel his diminutire limbs were eneased, while atlitional warmth was aflorded by tho great-coat already mentioned, the tails of which swept the floor after him like a train. IIaving silenced his dogs with some diffieculty, MIr. Ginger burst into a roar of laughter, excited hy the littlo old man's grotesque appearance, in which he was joined by the finker; but thoe Sandman never relaxed a muscle of his sullen cotntenance. Thcir @ilarity, however, was snddenly cheeked by an inquiry from t@e dwarf, in a shrill, odd tone, @Whether they hmad sent for him only to laugh at him ?'' @Sartaiuly not, deputy,'' replied the Tinker. :Here, lazy-bones, glasses o' rum-an'-vater, all round,'' Tho drowsy yonth bestirrel himself to exeeute the command. Tue spirit was brought; water wns procured from thoe loiling copper; and tho Tinkor handed his guest a smoking rummer, accompanicd with a polite reqnest to make himself comfortable. Opposite the table at which the party were seated, it has boen snid, @as a staireaso-old nnd erazy, and but imperfectly protected by a broken hand-rail. Miiway up it stood n door, equally dilapidatod, but secunrot by a chain and lock, of which Old Parr, as deputy-chamberlain, kept thc key. Beyond this point, the stnirease branchoed off on tho right, and a row of stount wooden banisters, ranged like the LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLmmmmm THE IAND AND TEE CLOAS. 51 feet of so many cattle, was visible from beneath. UIltimately, the staircaso reached a small gallery, if such as name can be applied to a narrow passage, communicating with the bedrooms, the doors of which, as a matter of needful precaution, were locked outside; and as the windows wcre grated, no one conld lenvo his chamber without the knowledge of thoe landlord or his representative. No lights were allo@ed in the bedrooms, nor in the pass@go adjoining them. Conciliated by tho Tinker's offering, Old Parr mounted the staircase, and planting himself near the door, took off his great-coat, and sat down upon it. His impish garb being thus moro fully displayed, he looked so nnearthly and extraordinary that tho dogs began to howl fearfully, nnd Ginger had eno@gh to do to quiet them. Bilence b@ing at length restored, tho Tinker, winking slyly at his companions, opened tho con@ersation. @I say, deputy,'' he observel, ' ve've bin havin' a bit o' a dispute vich you can settle for ns.'' @WeIl, let's see,'' squeaked the dwnr@. @What is it?" @Vy, it's relative to yo@r age,'' rejoinel the Tinker. @Wen wos yo@ born 2'' @It's so lo@g ago, I cnn't recollccet,'' returned Old Parr, rather snlkily. 4 You must ha' seen some changes in your time2'' res@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@o@@@@@@@@@@@m@@@@@o@@ progress with his grog. @I@rayther think I have-a few,'' replioel Old @arr, whose tongue tho generous liquil had loosened. @I@ve seen this r2 LLLLLLLLLLL 52 AURIOL. great city of London pullel down, and built up again-if that's anytling.

And a lo@ely spot it wasl Broad Saint Giles's, at the time I speak of, was a little country village, consisting of a few straggling houses, standing by tho roadside, and there wasn't a single habi. tation between it and Convent-garden (for so the present market was once called); while that garden, which was fenced ronnd with pales, like a park, extended from Saint MIartin'as-lane to Drury-house, a great mansion situated on tho easterly side of Drur-@lane, amid a grove of benutiful timber,'' e My e@es1' cried Ginger, with as prolonged whistle; tthe place must be preciously transmogrified indeed 1' 4 If I were to doseribe the changes thut ha@e talen place in London since I@'e known it, I might go on talking for a month,'' pursued Old Parr. @The whole aspect of the place is altered.

Remembering, ae I do, what the river used to ba when enlightened by gay eraft and merry company, I can't help wishing its waters less muddy, and those ugly coal@barges, lighters, and steamers, away. London is a mighty city, wonderful to behold and examine, inexhaustible in its wealth and power; but in point of beauty, it is not to be compared with the city of Queen Bess's days.

My curiosity being aroused, I listened at the door, and thougk I conld not distinguish much that passed inside, I hcard sufficient to convrince me that Doctor Lamb had made the grand disco@ery, and succeeded in distilling tho elixsir. Havring learnt this, I went down stairs, wondering what wonld next ensue. Half an hour elapsed, and while the bells were ringing in the new year joyfully, the young man whon I had assisted to cnrry up-stairs, and whom I supposed at death's door, mnrchel down as firmly as if notling had happened, passed by me, and disappeared, bofore I could shake off my astonishment. I saw at once he had drunk the elixir.'' @Ah :-ah lI'' exclaimed tho Tinker, with a knowing glance at his companions, who returnel it with gestures of cqual significance. @As soon as he was gone,'' pursued the dwarf, @I flew to the laboratory, and there, extended on the floor, I found the dend body of D@@@@r. Lamb. I debated with myself what to do-whether to pursue his mnrderer, for such I acconnted the young man; but, on reflection, I thought the coursa uscless. I next lookel round to see whether the precious olixir was gone. On the tablo stood s phial, from which n strong spirituons odonr exhaled; but it was empty. I then turned my attention to a recei@er, connected by a worm with an nlembic on the fnrnaco. On examining it, I found it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent liqnid, which, poured forth into a glass, emitted precisely mm 58 ARIOL. the same odonr as the phial. Persuaded this mnst ba the draught of immortality, I raised it to my lips; but apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand. Reassured, howe@er, by the thought of the young man's miraculous recovery, I quaffed the potion. It wns as if I had swallowed fire, and at first I thought all was over with me. I shrieked out; but there was no one to heed my cries, unless it were my dead mastcr, and two or three skeletons with which the walls sero garnished. And these, in truth, did seem to hear me; for the dead corpse opened its glassy orbs, and eyed me reproachfully; the skeletons shook their fleslless arms and gibbered; and tho various strange objects@ with which the chamber was filled, sceemed to deride and menace me. The terror occasioned by theso fantasics, combined with the potency of tho draught, took away my senses. When I reco@ered, I found all tranquil. Doctor Lamb was lying stark and stiff at my feet, with an expression of reproach on his fixed conntenance; and the skeletons were hanging quietly in their places. Conviuced that I wus proof against deatl, I went forth. But a curse went with mel Fromn that dsy to this, I have lived, but it has been in suech poverty and distress, that I had better far have died. @esides, I am constantly hauntel by visions of my old master. He seems to hold converse with me-to lead me into strange places.'' @Exactly the case with the t'other,'' whispered tha Tinker to the Sandman. @Have you erer, in the coorsa o' yonr long life, met the young man as drank the 'lixir 1'' he inguired of the dwarf. mLLLLLLLLLLL -------- Ne@er,' TL HAND AND THE OLOAK.@ @Do yon happen to rekileet his name1'' e No; it hass quite escaped my me@ory,'' answered Old Parr. t Should yon rekilect it, if you heerd it7'' asked tho Tinker. @Perhaps I might,'' returned the dwarf; @but I can't say.'' e Wos it Auriol Darcy 2'' demanded tho other. 4 That was the name,'' eried Old Parr, starting up in extreme surprise. @I heard Doctor Lamb call him so.

The dwarf was about to unclasp the book committed to his charge, when a hand was sudlenly thrust through the banisters of the upper part of the staircase, which, as has been already stated, was divided from the lower by the door. A picce of heary black drspery next descended like a cloud, concealing all behind it except the hand, with which the dwarf was suddenly seized by the nape of tha neck, lifted nup in tho air, and, not@ithstanding his shrieks nnd struggles, carried clean off. . Great confusion attended his disnppearance. The dogs set up a prodigious bnrking, and flew to thoe rescue-one of the largest of them passing o@er the body of tho drowsy waiter, who had sought his custorary couch upon the coals, and rousing him from his slumbers; whilo the Tinker, uttering a fierce imprcecation, npset his chair in his haste to catch hold of the dwarf's legs; but the latter was already out of reach, and the next moment had vanishoed entirely, @My eyesl here's a pretty gol'' cried Ginger, who, with his back to the firo, hmad witnessed the occurrenee in open-mouthed astonishment. : Vy, curse itI1 if the wenerable ain't a-takon tho pocket-book with him1 It's my opinion the devil has flown a@ay with the old feller.

And, dashing up the stairs, he caught lold of the railing above, and swinging himself up by a powerful effort, passed throughl an opening, occasioned by the remo@al of one of the bnnistcrs.

The occupants of the different chnmbers, nlarmed by the noise, called out to know what was going forward; but being locked in their rooms, they could renler no assistanco. Whilo the Tinker was thus pursuing his search in the dark, venting his rage and disappointment in tle most dreadful imprecations, the staircase door was openel by the landlord, who had found the key in the great-coat left behind by the dwarf. W@th the landlord came the Sandman and Ginger, the latter of whom was attended by all lis dogs, still barking furiously; whilo tho rear of the party was brought up by the drowsy waiter, now wile awako with fright, and carr@ing a eandle.

A w@ER had elapsed since Auriol Darey was con@eyed to the iron-merchant's dwolling, after the altaek male npon him by tho ruffians in the ruined honse; and though almost recoverel from the serious injuries he had recci@ed, he still remained thoe guest of his presor@er. It was a bright spring morning, when a door lending to tlo yard in front of the house opened, and a young girl, briglt and fresh as the morning's self, issued from it. A lo@elier creaturo than E@ba Thorneycroft cannot bhe imagined. IIer figuro was perfection-slight, tall, and ra@ishingly proportioned, with a slender waist, little limbs, nnd fairy feet that would ha@e made the fortune of an opcra-dnncer. Hoer features were almost angclic in expression, with an outlino of the utmost delicacy and precision-not cold, classical regularity-but that softer and incomparably more lovely mould pecnliar to our own clime. Ebbn's counlenance was a type of Saxon beauty. Hor complexion was pure white, tinged with a slight bloom. IIer eyes were of a serene summer blue, arched o@er by brows somo shades darker than the radiant tresses that fell on either cheek, and were parted o@er a brow smoother than alabaster. Her attire was simple, but tasteful, and A0RBIOL. by its dark colour threw into relief the exceeding fair@ess of her skin. Ebba's first caro was to feed her fa@ourite linnet, placed in a csgo over the door. Ha@ing next patted the head of a huge bulldog who came ont of his kennel to greet her. and exchanged a few words with two men employed at a forge in the inner part of the building on the right, she advanced farther into the yard. This part of tho premises, being strewn wit@ ironwork of every pcssible shape, presented a very singular appearance, and may merit some description. There were heaps of rusty iron chains flang tagether like fishermen's nets, old iron area-guards, iron kitchen-fenders, old grates, safes, piles of old iron bowls, a large assortment of old iron pans and dishes, a ditto of old ovens, kettles without number, sledge-hammers, an@ils, braziers, chimney-cowls, and smoke@jaeks. Stout upright posts, supporting eross-beams on the top, were placed at intervals on oither side of the yard, and these were decorated, in the most artistic style, with rat@traps, man-tr@ps, iron lanterns, pnlleys, padlocks, chains, trivets, triangles, iron rods, disused strcet lampe, dismounted cannon@ and anchors. Attached to hooks in the cross-bcam nearest the house hung a row of old horse@shoes, while from the centre depended a largo rusty bell. Near the dog's kennel was a tool-box, likewise garnished with horse-shoes, and containing pincers, filos, hnmmers, and otler implements proper to the smith. @eyond this TEE IRON-AERCANT's DAUGTE. G5 was an open doorway leading to the workshop, where tho two men before montioned were busy nt the forge. Though it was still early, the road was astir with passengers, and many waggons and carts, la@en with hay, straw, and vegctables, were passing. Ebba, hoxe@er, had been solely drawn forth by the beauty of the morning, and she stopped for a moment at the street gate, to breathe the balmy air. As she inhaled the gentle breeze, and felt the warm sunshine upon her cheek, her tioughts wanderel away into the green meadows in which she had strayed as a child, and sho longed to ramble amid them again. Perhaps she scarcely desired a solitary stroll; but however this might be, she was too much engrossed by tho re@erie to notiee a tall man, wrapped in a long black clonk, who regarded her with the most fixed attention, as he passed on the opposite side of the road. Proceeding to a short distance, this personage crossed over, and returned slowly towards tho iron-merchant's d@elling. Ebba then, for the first time, remarked him, and was startled by his strange, sinister appearance. His features were handsome, but so malignant and fiorco in expression, that they inspired only aversion. A sardonic grin curled his thin lips, and his short, crisply-curled hair, ra@en black in hue, contrasted forcibly and disagreeably with his caluaverous complexion. An attraction lik@ that of the snake seemed to resido in his dark blazing eyes, for Ebba trembled like a bird beneath their influence, and conld not remo@e her gaze from them.

He was pale, as if from recent suffering, and bore his left arm in a sling. @Yon look agitated,'' ho said, noticing Ebba's nneasiness. @What has happened ' @Not much,'' she rcplied, a deep blush mantling hcr cheeks. `` But I ha@e been somewhat alarmed by the person near the gate,'' @Indeed?'' cried Auriol, darting forward. 4Where is he?

Ebba stopped, and the bloom suddenly forsook ler cheeks. But Auriol seemed nnable to proceed.

And she again cast down her eyes; but Auriol made no reply. Fortunately the silence was broken by the clinking of the smiths' hammers upon the anvil. @If you must r@ally go,'' said Ebba, looking up, after@a long pause, `` I hope we shall see yon again7'' @MIost assuredly,'' replied Auriol. @I owe your worthy fatloer a deep debt of gratitude-a debt which, I fear, I shall never be able to repay.'' @My father is more than repaid in saving your life,'' she replied. ``I am sure he will be sorry to learn you are going so soon.'' 4 I have been here a week,'' snid Auriol. @If I remasined longer, I might not bo able to go at all,'' There was another pause, during which a stout old fellow in the workshop quitted the anvil for a moment, nnd, catching a glimpse of the young couple, muttered to his helpmate: @I say, Ned, @Tm a-thinkin' our master'll soon have a son-in-law.

Glancing at kis watch, and finding it w@nted nearly three-quarters of an hour of tha time appointed for his meeting with the mysterions stranger, he struck across the Park, in the direction of the Serpentine Ri@er. Apparently he wss now perfectly reco@ered, for his arm was without the support of the sling, and he walked with great swiftness. But his conntenance was deathly pale, and his looks were so wild and disordered, that the few persons he encountered shrank from him aghast zz AIOL. A few minutes' rapid walking brought him t@ th@ eastern extremity of the Serpentine, and ad@ancing close to the edge of the embankment, he gazed at the waters beneath his feet. @I would plange into them, if I could find repose,'' @e murmured. @But it wonld avail nothing. I should only add to my sufferings. No; I must continue to endure the weight of a life burdened by crime and remorse, till I can find out the means of freeing myself from it. Once I dreaded this unknown danger, but now I seok for it in vain.'' Tho current of his thoughts were here interrupted by the sudden appearance of a dark object on the sunrface of the water, which he at first took to be a huge fish, with a pair of green fins springing from its back; but after watching it more closely for a few moments, he became con@inced that it was a human being, tricked out in some masqnerade attire, while the slight struggles which it male pro@ed that life was not entirely extinet. Though, tho moment bofore, hoe had contemplatel self@destruction, and had only been restrained from the attcmpt by the certainty of failing in his purpose, instinct promptel him to rescue the perishing ereature before him. Without hesitation, therefore, and withont tarrying to di@est himsolf of his clothes, he dashed into tho water, and striking out, instantly reached the object of his quest, whieh still continued to float, and turning it orer, for the face was downwards, he perceived it was an old man, of exceedingly small @ize, habited in a pantomimic garb. IIo also remarked LL TE EETING NEAR TIE sTATOE. 73 that a rope was twisted ronnd the neck of the unfortunata being, making it evrident that some violent attempt had been made upon his life. WIthout pausing for further investigation, he took firm hold of the leathern wings of the dwarf, and with his diseng@ged hand propelled himself towards the shore, dragging the other after him. The next instant he reached the b@nk, clambered up the lo@ brickwork, and placed his burden in safety. The noise of the plunge had attracted attention, and several persons now hurried to tho spot. On coming up, and finding Auriol bending over a water-sprite--for such, at first sight, thoe dwarf appeared-they could not repress thcir asstonishment.

Arrived there, he looked around, and not seeing any one@ flung himself upon a bench at the foot of the gentle eminence on which tle gigantic statue of Achilles is placed. It was becoming rapidly dark, and heavy clonds, portending speedy rain, increased the gloom.

Recoiling at tho touch, he raised his eyes, and beheld the stranger leaning over him, and gazing at him with a look of diabolical exultation. The cloak was thrown partly aside, so as to display the tall, gaunt figure of its wearer; while the large collar of suble fur with which it was decorated stood out like the wings of a demon. The stranger's hat was off, and his high broad forehead, whitc as marble, was fully rerealed. @Our meeting must be brief,'' he said. tAre you preparel to ful@6l the compact@7 @Whnt do you require 2'' replied Auriol. @Possession of the girl I saw three days ago,'' sail th@ other; @the iron-merchant's daughter, Ebbn.

HBesides, yon are likely to see some noticeable characters, for Mr. Trigge's shop is quite as lounge. Perhsps you may find a young barrister who has just been '' callel,'' ordering his `first wig,'' and you may hear the prognostications of Mr. Trigge as to his future distinetion. @Ah, sir,'' ha will say, glancing at the stolid features of the young @an, ``you have quite the faco of tho Chiof Justice-quite tlo face of tho chief-I don't reeollect him ordering his first wig-that was a little before my tine; but I hope to liva to sce you chief, sir.

His shop is also frequented by managing clerks, barristers' clerks, engrossing clerks, and others; but these are, for the most part, his privrate friends.

No, it is a real barber's and hairdresser's shop, of the good old stamp, where you may get cut and curled for a shilling, aud sha@ed for half the price. True, the floor is not eovered wit@@a carpet.

In the window, thoere is an assortment of busts moulded in wax, exhibiting the triumphs of Mr. Trigge's art; and, above these, are several specimens of legal wigs.

One cannot carn the appellation of the Barbcr of Loulon withont talent; and it is tho consciousness of this talent thmat lends to MIr. Trigge's features thcir apparently conceited expression. A fringe of black whisker adorns @is cheek and chin, and his black bristly hair is brushel baek, so as to exhibit the prodigious expansc of his forelead. IIis eycbrows are oelevated, ass if in constant scorn. The attire in which Mr. @rigge is ordinarily seen, consists of a blacl vel@et waisteoat, and tight black continuations. These are protected by a wlite apron tied round his waist, with pockets to hold his scissors and combs; over all, ho wears a short n@nkeen jacket, into the pockets of which his hands are constantly thrust vhen not otherwise employed, A black satin stoeke with a largo bow encireles his throat, nnl Iis shirt is fnstened by black enamel studs.

Ix spite of his resolution to the contrary, Auriol fonnd it impossible to resist the fascination of Ebb@'s society, and became a daily visitor at hcr father's house. Mr. Thorneycroft noticed the growing attachment between them with satisfaction. His great wish was to see his dsuglter nnited to the husband of her choice, and in the hope of smoothing the way, ho let Auriol understand that le should give her a considerable marriage-portion. For the last few days a wonderful alteration had taken place in Auriol's manner, and he seemed to have shaken off altogether the cloud that had hithierto sat upon his spirits. Enchanted by the change, Ebbs indulged in the most blissful anticipations of the future. One e@ening they walked forth together, and almost nnconsciou@ly directed their steps towards tho river. Lingering on its banks, they gazed on the full tide, admired the glorious sunset, and breathed over and over again thosa tender nothings so eloquent in lo@ers' ears. @Oh1 how different you are from what you were as week ago,'' said Ebba, playfull@. @Promise me not to indulge in any more of those gloomy fancies.'' @I@will not indulge in them if I can help it, rest assured n 2 LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLmLLLLLLLLLmmmm 100.

And he sunffered himself to be led in the direction proposed. Ebba continued to talk, but hoer disconrse fell upon a deaf ear, nnd at last she became silent too. In this way they proceeded along Millbank-street and Abingdon-street, until, turning off on the riglt, they found themselves before an old and partly-demolished bnilding. By this time it had become quite dark, for the moon was hidden behind a rack of clouds, but a light was seen in the upper stor@y of the structure, oceasioned, no donbt, by a fire within it, which ga@e a very picturesque effect to the hroken outline of the walls. Pausing for a moment to contemplate the ruin, Ebba expressed a wish to enter it. Anriol offered no opposition, and passing through an arched doorway, and ascending a short, spiral, stone staircase, they presently arri@ed at@a roofless chamber, which it was e@ident, from the implements and rubbish lying about, was about to be razed to the ground. On one side there was a large areh, partly bricked up, through which opened s nurrow d@or@ay, thongh at somo height from the ground. With this a 101 ARIOL. plank communicated, while beneath it lay a great heap of stones, amongst which were some grotesque car@ed he@ds. In the centre of the chamber was s large square opening, like the mouth of a trap-door, from which the top of a ladder projeeted, and near it stood a flaming brazier, which had csst forth the glare seen from below. O@er the ruinous walls on the right hung the crescent moon, now emerged from tho cloud, and shedding a ghostly glimmer on the scene. @What a strange placel'' eriol Ebba, gazing aronnd with some apprehension. @It looks like a spot one reads of in romance.

Listen to me, Ebbs, and however strange my recital may appear, do not suppase it the ravings of a madman, but be assured it is the truth.'' @Beware 1'' cried a deep voice, issuing apparently from the depths of the vault. @Some one spoke,'' cried Ebba. ``I begin to shars @our apprehensions.

Ono of them was remarknble for his dwarfish astature and strange withered fe@tures. Tho other was a man of middle sizc, thin, rather olderly, and with a sharp countenance, tlo sourness of which was redee@ed by a strong expression of benesolence. HIe was clad in a black coat, rather rusty, but well brushed, buttoned up to the chin, black tights, short drub gaiters, and wore a white neckcloth and spectaclee. Mr. Loftas (for so ho was called) was a retired merchant, of moderate fortune, and lived in Abingdon-street. Ha was a bachelor, and therefore pleased himself; and being a bit of an antiquary, rambled abont all day long in search of some object of interest. His walk, on the present occnsion, was taken with that vicw. eDy Jovrel what a noble statue that is, MIorso1'' cried TRE BTATUE AT CIAING-CBOS8. 105 Loftus, gazing at it. te The horse is magnificent-positively magnificent.'' @I recollect when the spot was occnpied by a gibbet, and when, in lieu of a statue, an effigy of the marty@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@r@@@@ed @@@@:.@@@@::@::;@:-@the timo of the Proteetorate.'' @You cannot get those dreams out of your head, Morse,'' said Loftus, smiling. @I wish I c@uld persuade myself I had lived for two centuries and a half,'' @Would you could ha@o seen the ancient ecross, whlch once stood there, erected by Edward tho Firet to his beloved wife, ' Eleanor of Castile,''' said Morso, heedless of theI other's remark. @It was much mutilated when I remember it; some of the pinnaeles weroe broken, and tho foliage defaced, bnt the statues of the queen were still standing in the recesses; and altogether the eflect was beautiful,'' @It must have been charming,'' obser@ed Loftus, rubbing his hands; '`and, t@ough I like the statue, I would much rather have had the old Gothic cross. But how fortunate the former eseaped destruction in Oli@er Cromwell's time.'' @I can tell yon how that camo to pass, sir,'' replied Morse, `` for I was assistant to John Rivers, the brazier, to whom tho statue was sold,' @AhI indeed 1'' exclaimed Loftns. %I have heard something of the story, but shonld liko to have full particulars.'' @You shall henr them, then,'' replied Morse. :Yon statue, which, as you know, was cast by Habert le Sueur, in 1633, was ordered by @prliament to be sold and brokcen to pieces. Well, my master, John Rivers, being a staunch royalist, though he did not dare to a@ow his principles, 106 AIoL. determinel to preserve it from destruction. Accordingly, he offered a good round sum for it, and was declared tho purehaser. But how to dispose of it was thoe difliculty 1 He could trust none of his men but me, whom he knoew to be as hearty a hater of the Roundheads, and as loyal to the memory of our slaughtered sorereign, as himself. Well, we digged a great pit, secretly, in the cellar, whitler the statne had been con@eyed, and buried it. The job occupiecd us nearly a month; and during that time, my naster collected together all the pieces of old brass he could procure. These he afterwards produced, and declared they were tle fragments of the statue. But the cream of the jest was to come. He began to cast handloes aof knives nnd forks in brass, giving it out that they were made from the metal of the statue. And plenty of 'em he sold too, for the Cavaliers bought 'em as memorials of their martyred monarch, and the Roundheads as e@idences of his fall. In this way he soon got back his outlay,'' @Ha1 ha I ha l'' langhed Loftus. @W@ll, in due season came the Restoration,'' pursued MIorse; `` and my master made known to Iing Charles tha Seeond the treasure he had kept concealed for him. It was digged forth, placed in its old position-but I forget whether the brazier was rewarded. I rather think not,'' @No matter,'' cried Loftus; '' he w@s sufficiently rewarded by the consciousness of ha@ing done a noble action.

E@ery one k@ows how easily a crowd is oollocted in London, and it cannot be supposed that our two antiquaries would be allowed to pursue their investigations unmolosted. Several ragged urehins got round them, and tried to discover what they were looking at, at t@e same time cutting their jokes upon them. Theso were speedily joined by a street-s@eeper, rather yo@ng in the profession, a ticket@porter, a butcher's apprcntice, an oll Israelitish clothes-man, a coalheaver, and a couple of charity-boys. @My eyes.'' eried the street-sweeper, '`only twig these co@es.

Not a word was spoken by any one during the ride. After a while, the coaceh stopped, the door was openel, and Mr. Thorneyeroft was helped out. The iron-merchant expected his bandage would now be removed, but he was mistaken, for Reeks, taking his arm, drew him along at a quick pace. As they ad@anced, the iron-merchant's conductor whispered him to be csutious, and, at the samc time, made him keep close to a wall.

Thongh almost deprived of consciousness by terror, the poor girl could distinguish, from the mo@ements of her captor, that she was bomne down a flight of steps, or some steep descent, and then for a considerablo distanee along le@el ground. Sho@was next placel in a carriage, which was dri@en with great swiftness, and thongh it was impossible to conjectnre in what direction she was con@e@ed, it seemed to her terrified imagination as if she were hurried down s precipice, and she exrpected e@ery moment to bo dashed in pieces. At length, the vehiclae stopped, and she was lifted out of it, and carried along a winding passage; after which, the creaking of hinges announced that a door was opened. Ha@ing passed TIE CAMIBER O YBTEnY. 119 through it, ahe was deposited on a bench, when, fright o@ermastering her, her senses completely forsook her. On recovrering, she found herself seated on a fauteuil covered with black vel@et, in tho midst of a gloomy chamber of vast extent, while beside her, and supporting her from fualling, stood the mysterious and terriblo stranger. HIo hell a large goblet filled with some potent liquid to her lips, and compelled her to swallow a portion of it. Tho powerful stimulant revived her, but, at the same time, produced a strange excitement, against which she straggled with all her power. Her persecutor again held the goblet towards her, while a sardonic smile played upon his features. @Drink :'' he ecried; ``it will restore you, and you have much to go through.'' Ebba mechanically took the cup, and raised it to her lips, but noticing the stranger's glance of exultation, dashed it to the ground. e Yon hase acted foolishly,'' ho sail, sternly; ``the potion would havo dono you good.'' Withdrawsing her eyes from his gaze, which she felt exercised an irresistible influence ovcr her, Ebbas gazed fearfully round the chamber. It was vast and gloomy, and seemed like the interior of a sepulchre-the walls and ceiling being formed of black marble, while the @loor was paved with the samo material. Not far from where she sat, on an estrade, approached by n couple of steps, stood a table oovered with blaek velvet, on which was placed an immense lamp, fashioued like an imp supporting a caldron on his outstretched wings. In 120 AUn1OL. this lamp weroe se@eral bnrners, which cast a lurid light tlroughout the chamber. O@er it hung a cap equally fantastically fashioned. A udagger, with a riclly-wrought hilt, was stuck into the table; and beside it lay a strangely shaped mask, an open book, an antique inkstand, and a piece of parchment, on which some characeters @ere inscribed. Opposite tlese stood a curiously-carvred ebony chair. At the lower end of thoe room, which was slightly elevated above tho rest, hung a large black curtain; and on th@ step, in the front of it, were placed two vases of jet. WWhat is behind that curtain?'' shudleringly demanded Ebba of her companion. @You will see anon,'' he repliod. ' Meanwhile, seat yourself on that chair, and glance at the writing on the scroll'' Ebbs did not mo@e, but the stranger took her hand, and drew har to the seat.

Ebbs continued to pray fervently for her own deliverance, and for that of Auriol. In the midst of her supplications she was aroused by strains of musio of tho most exquisita sweetness, proceeding apparently from bchind the curtain, and while listening to these sounds she was startled by a denfening crash as if as large gong had been stricken. Tho cover of the lamp was then slowly raised, and the burners blazed forth as before, while from the t@o vases in front of the curtain arose clouds of incense, filling the chamber with stupifying fragrance. Again the gong was stricken, and Ebba looked round towards tho eurtain. Above each vase towered a gigantic figure, wrapped in a long black clo@k, the lo@er part of which was coneealed by the thick @apour. Ioods, like tha cowls of monks, were drawn o@er the heads of these grim and motionless figures; mufflers enroloped their chins, and they wore masks, from the holes of which gleamed eyes of unearthly brightness. Their hands were crossea upon their breasts. Between them sqnatted two other spectrnl forms, similarly cloaked, hooded, and masked, with their gleaming eyes fixed upon her, and their skinny fingers pointed derisi@ely at her. Behind the curtain was placed a strong light, which showed a wide staircase of blackc marble, leading to soma @pper chamber, and at the same time threw the reflection ol 1 12 AURIOL. gigantic f@gure upon the drapery, while a hand, the finger of which pointed towards her, was thrust from an openi@g between its folds. Forcibly averting her gaze, Euba covered hcr eyes with her hands, but looking up again after a brief space, bcheld an ebon door at the side re@olve upon its hinges, aud give entrance to three female figures, robed in blaek, hoodel and veiled, and ha@ing their hands folded, in a melancholy manner, across their breasts. Slowly and noiselessly advancing, they halted witlin a fe@ paces of her. @Who, and what are ye 1'' she cried, wild with terror. @Tho @ictims of Auriol 1'' replied the figure on the right. 2As we are, such will you bo ere long.'' @What erime have you committed?'' demanded Ebba. @We have lored him,'' replied the seecond figure. @Is that a crimel'' cried Ebba. @If so, I am equally culpable with you.'' @Yon will share our doom,'' replied the third fig@re. t Heaven have mercy upon mel'' exclaimed the agonised girl, dropping upon her knees. At this moment a terrible voice from behind the curtsin exclaimed@@@Sign, or Auriol is lost for erer.'' e I cannot yield my soul, evren to save him,'' cried Ebba, distractelly. @Witness his chastisement, then,'' cried tle voice. And as the words were uttered, a side door was opened on the opposite side, and Auriol was dragged forth from it ------TIIE CIAMIBEB OF ISTEY. 123 by two masked personages, who looked liko familiars of tho @@quisition. @Do not yield to the demands of this fiend, Ebba@1 eried Auriol, gazing at her distractedly. eWill yon sa@o him before ho is cast, li@ing, into t@e tomb 1'' cried the @oice. A@d at the words, a heasy slab of marble rose slowly from the floor near @here Ebba sat, and disclosed a dark pit beneath. Ebba gazed into the abyss with indescribable terror. @There he will be immured, unless you sign,'' criedl tho voice; '` and, as he is immortal, he will endure an eternity of torture.'' @I cannot save him so, but I muy precede him,'' cried Ebba. And throwing her hands aloft, she flung herself into the pit. A fearful cry resonnded throngh the chamber. It broke from Auriol, who @@inly strove to burst from those who held him, nnd precipitate himself after Ebba@ Soon after this, and while Auriol was gazing into the abyss, a tongue of blue flame arosoe from it, danced for a moment in the air, and then vanishoed. No sooner was it gone than a figure, shroudedl in black habiliments, and hooded and mu@fled np liko the three other female forms, slowly ascended from the vault, apparently without support, and remained motionless at its brink. @Ebbal'' exclaimed Auriol, in a voice of despsir. @Is it you?' 1A AU1OL. The figure bowed its head, but spoke not. `Sign 1'' thundered the voice. 4 Your attempt at self@destruetion has placed you wholly in m@ power. SignI'' At this injunction, the figure mored slowly towards the table, and, to his unspeakable horror, Auriol beheld it take] up the pen and write upon the parchment. He bent forward, and saw that tho name inscribed thereon was EsnA] IT@o@nxYCROFT. The groan to which he gsve utterance was echoed by@as roar of diabolical laughter. The figure then moved slowly away, and ranged itself with the other @eiled forms. @All is accomplished,'' cried the @oice. @Away with him@@ On this, a terrible clangour was heard; the lights wera extinguished; and Auriol was dragged through the doorway from which he had been brought forth. @@@nter@@@@@@@@@m@@@@@@@e@@@a,-1800., --O@ the night of tho 1st of March, 1800, and st a late hour, a man, wrapped in a large horseman's cloak, and of strangoe and sinister appearance, entered an old deserted house in the neighbourhood of Stepney-green. He was tall, carried himself very erect, and seemed in the full vigour of early manhood; but his features had a worn and ghastly look, as if bearing the stamp of long-indulged and frightful excesses, while his dark gleaming eyes gave him an expression almost diabolical. This person had gained the house from a garden behind it, and now stood in a large dismantled hall, from which a broad oaken staircnse, with cnriously-car@ed banisters, led to a gallery, and thence to the upper chambcrs of the habitation. Nothing could be more dreary than the aspect of tho place. The richly-moulded ceiling was festooned with spiders' webs, and in some places had fallen in heaps upon the floor; the glories of the tapestry upon thoe walls ware obliterated by damps; the squares of black and white marble, with which the hall was pavet, were loosened, and LI 120 AUnIOL. quaked beneath the footsteps; the wide and empty fireplace yawned like the mouth of a ca@ern; the bolts of the closed windows were rusted in their sockets; and the henps of dust before the outer door proved thnat long years had celaypscd since any one had passed through it. Taking a dark lantemn from beneath his cloak, the indi@idunal in question gazed for a moment around him, and then, with a sardonie smile playing upon his features, directed his steps towards a room on tle right, the door of which stood open. Tlis chamber, which was large and cased with osk, was wholly unfuruishel, like the hall, and in an equally dilnpidated condition. Tha only decoration remaiuing on its walls was the portrait of a venerable personage in the cap nnd gown of Henry the Eighth's time, painted agninst a panel-a circumstance wlich hnd probably saved it from destruction-and beneatl it, fixed in another panel, a plate of br@ss, covered with mystical characters and symbols, and inseribel with the name @@@prianus @e IReugement, 5fra. I.C.@ Tho same name likcwise appeared upon a label beneath the portrait, with the date, 1550. Pausing bofore the portrait, the young man threw tho light of the lantern full upon it, and re@ealed features somcwhat resembling his own in form, but of a se@ere and philosophic cast. In the eyes alone could be discerned the peculiar nnl terrible glimmor which distinguished his own glances. Aftecr regarling the portrait for some time fixellr, h@ tlus addresscl it: TnE TOYB OF TIE OSICRUCIA. 127 Dost hear me, old aneestor7'' he criod. 4I, thy descendant, Cyprian de Rougemont, call upon thee to point out where thy gold is hidden1 I know that thou wert a brother of the Rosy Cross-one of the illuminati-nnd didst penetrate the mysteries of nature, and enter the region of light.

The conditions ho proposed were, that I should either gi@e him my own soul, or win him that of Auriol Darcy. I assentod. I am here. Where is thy treasure?'' After a pause, he strack the portrait with his clencled hand, exclaiming, in a loud @oice: @Dost hear me, I say, old ancestor7 I cnll on thee to gi@e me thy treasure. Dost hear, I say 7'' And ho rcpeatod tho blow with greater @iolence. Disturbel by the shocek, the brass plate beneath the picture started from its place, and fell to the ground. @WYhat is this1'' criod Rougemont, gazing into th@ aperture loft by the plate. ` Hal-my invocntion has been heard I And, snatching up thc lantern, he discorered, at tho bottom of a little recess, about two feet deep, a stone, with nsn iron ring in the centre of it. Uttering a joyful cry, he seized the ring, and drew the stone forward without difficulty, disclosing an open space beyond it. 12s AIOL. This, then, is the entrance to my ancestor's tomb,'' cried Rougemont; '` there can be no doubt of it. The old Rosicrucian has kept his seeret well; but the devil has helped me to wrest it from him. And now to procure the necessary implements, in case, ass is not unlikely, I should experience further difficulty.'' W@th this, he hastily quitted the room, but returued almost immediately with a mallet, a lever, and a pitchfork; armed with w@ich and the lantern, he crept through the aperture. IThis done, he found himself at the head of a stone staircase, which he descended, and came to the arched entrance of a vsult.

Massi@e chains of the more costly metal, fashioned like twisted snakes, ser@ed as suspenders to the lamp. But Rougemont's astonishmont at this marvel quickly gave way to other feelings, and he gazed around tle vault with greedy eyes. It was a eeptilateral chamber, about eight feet high, built of stone, and supported by beautifully groined arches. The surface of the masonry was as smooth and fresh as if the chisel had only just left it. In six of the corners were placed large chests, ornamented with ironwork of the most exquisite workcmanship, and these Rougemont's imagination pictured as filled with inexhanstible treasure; while in the se@enth corner, near the door, wus a beautiful little piece of monumental sculpture in white marble, representing two kneeling and hooded figures, holding a veil between them, which partly conccalcd the entrance to s small recess. On ono of the chests opposite the monument just deseribed stood s strangely-formed bottle and as cup of antique workmanship, both incrusted with gems. The walls were covered with circles@ squares, and dis 5----.l 130 ARIOIL. grams, and in some places were ornamented with grotesque carvings. In the centre of the vsult was a round altar, of black marble, covered with a plate of gold, on which Rougemont read the following inscription: @boe uniners@ cem@enuium tnius mihi sepulcrum fecf.@ IIero, then, old Cyprian lics,'' he cried. And, prompted by some irresistible impulse, he seized the altar by the upper rim, and o@erthrew it. The heavy nass of marble fell with a thundering crash, breaking asunder the flag beneatl it. It @ight be the roverberation of the vaultcd roof, but a deep groan seemed to reproach the young man for bis sacrilege. Undeterred, however, by this warning, Rongemont placed the point of the lever between the intoratices of thioe broken stone, und, exerting all his strength, speedily raisel the fragments, and laid open the grave. Within it, in the garb he ware in life, with his wlite beard streaning to his waist, lay tle uncoffined body of his ancestor, Cyprian de Rougenont. The corpse hnd evidently bcen curefully cmbalmed, and the features were unchanged by decay. Upon the breast, @ith the hands placed o@er it, lay a large book, bound in black vellum, and fastened with brnzen clasps. Instantly possessing himself of this mysterious-looking volume, IRougemont knelt upon the nearest chest, and opened it. But ho was dissppointed in his expectation. All the pages he examined were filled with cabalistic characters, which he was totally unable to decipher. At length, howe@er, he chanced upon one page, the TRE TOYIB OF TIE OSICRCCIAN. 131 import of which he comprehendel, and he remained for some ti@e absorbod in its contemplation, while an almost fiendish smile played upon his featnres. ``Aha l'' he exclaimed, closing the @olume, '` I see now tho causo of my extraordinary dream.

Tho next he visited in the sano way was full of gold. The third was laden with pearls and precious stones; and the rest contained treasure to an incalculable amo@nt. Rougemont gazed at them in transports of joy. @At length I hase my wish,'' he ecriel. @Boundless wealth, and therefore boundless power@ is mine. I can riot in plcasure-riot in vengeanee.

Their path led tlrough as grove, in the midst of which was a fonntain; and they were hastening towards its marble brink, when all at once Edith uttcred a scream, and, starting basck, pointed to a large black snake lying befare her, anl upon which she wonld havoe trodden the next moment. Auriol sprang forward and tried to crush the reptilo with his heel; but, a@oiling the blow, it coiled around lis leg, and plungcd its venom tceth into his flosh. The anguish occasioned by the imaginary wound roused him from his slumber, and looking up, ho percei@ed that a ser@ant wnas in attendance.

And, getting np, ho followed thoe man, almoet meehanically, out of the room. @@EDITH TALBOT. Iy. 143 Ir was late when Auriol srose on the following morning. At first, finding himself in a large and most laxuriantly@furmnished chamber, he was at a loss to conceive how he camo there, and it was somo timo before he could fully reca@l the mysterious events of the prevrious night. As had been foretold, however, by @ougemont, his position did not cansae him so much anxiety as before, After attiring himself, he descended to tho lower apartments, in ono of which s sumptuous breakfast awaited him; and having partaken of it, he took a complete survey of the house, and found it larger and more magnificent even than he had supposed it. He next supplied himself Ifromn the poeket-book with a certain sum, for which @e fancied he might have occasion in the course of the day, and sallicd forth. His first business was to proenre a splendid carriage and horses, and to order somo new and rich hasbiliments to be made with the ntmost expedition. He then proceeded towards May Fair, and knoclel al the door of a large house at the upper end of Curzon-street. His heart beat violently as he was shown iuto an elegant drawing-room, and his trepilation momentarily inereased, @ntil the servant reasppeared and expressed his regret thnt ha had misinformned him in stating that Miss Talbot was 144 AUnIOL. at home. Both she and Mr. ITalbot, he sasid, had gone out about half an honr ago. Auriol looked incredulous, but, without making any remark, departed@ HIurrying home, he wrote a few lines to Mr. Talbot, announcing the sudden and extraordinary change in his fortune, and formally demanding the hand of Edith. He was abont to despatch this letter, when a note was brouglt him by his servant. It was from Edith. Ha@ing ascertained his new adlress from his card, she wrote to assnre him of her constant attachment. Transnorted by tlis proof of her affecction, Auriol half de@oured the note with kisses, and instantly sent off his own letter to her father-merely adding a few words to say that he would call for an answer on the morrow. But he had not to wait thus long for a reply. Ere an hour had elapsed, Mr. Talbot brought it in person. Mr. Talbot was a man of about sixty-tall, thin, and gcentleman-like in deportment, with grey hair, and black eyobrows, which lent considerablo expression to the orbs beneath them. His complexion was a bilions brown, and he possessed none of the good looks which in his daughter had so capti@ated Auriol, and which it is to be prcsumed, tlerefore, she inheritei from her mother. A thorough man of tho world, though not an unamiabl@ person, Mr. Talbot was entirely influenced by selfish considerutions. He had litherto looked with an untfa@ourable eye upon Auriol's attentions to his daughter, from a notion that the conne@xion would be very undesirable in a pecuniary point of view; but the magnificence of the house in Saint EDITR TALBOT. 145 James's-square, which fully bore ont Auriol's account of his newly-acguired wealth, wronght a complete change in his opinions, and he soon gave the yonng man to @nderstand that he shonld be delighted to have him for a son@in-la@. Finding him so fa@ourably disposed, Auriol entreated him to let the marriage take place-within threa dasys, if possible. Mr. Talbot was greatly grieved that he eould not comply with his young friend's reqnest, but he w@s obliged to start the next morning for Nottingham, and conuld not potsibly return under three days. @Bnt we can be married before you gof'' cried Auriol. @Scareely, I fear,'' replied Mr. Talbot, smiling blandly. e Yon must control your impatience, my dear young friend. On the sixth day from this-that is, on Wednesday in next week-we are now at Friday-you shall be made happy.'' The coincidence between this appointment, and the time fixed by Rougemont for the delivery of his victim, struck Auriol forcibly. His emotion, howeaer, escaped Mr. Talbot, who soon after departed, having engaged his future son-in@law to dine with him at se@en o'clock. Anriol, it need scarcely be said, was pnnctaal to the hour, or, rather, ho anticipated it. He found Edith alone in the drawing-room, and seated near the window, which was filled with choieest flowers. On seeing him, she nttered an exclamation of joy, and sprang to meet him. The yonng man pressed his lips ferrently to the little hand extended to him. Edith Talbot was a lovrely brunette. Her features were re1406 AIOL. gnlar, and her eyes, which were perfectly splendid, were dark, nlmond-shaped, and of almost Oriental languor. Her hair@ which she wore braided over her brow and gathered behind in a massive roll, was black and glossy as a ra@en's wing. Her cleeks were dimpled, her lips of velvet softness, and her teeth like ra@ges of pearls. Perfect grace aceompanied all her mo@ements, and one only wondered that feet so @mall as those she possessed shonld ha@e thoe power of sustaining a form which, though lightsome, was yet rounded in its proportions. e You hase heard, dear Edith, that yonr father has consentcd to our nnion 1'' said Auriol, after ga@ing at her for a few moments in silent admiration. Edith murmnred an affirmative, and blushed deeply. @Ie has fixed Welnesday nest,'' pnrsued Anriol ; `` b@t I wish an earlier day could ha@e been named. I have a presentiment that if our marriage is so long delayed, it will not take place at all,'' @Yon are full of misgi@ings, Auriol,'' she replied. @I confess it,'' he sanid; `` and my apprehensions ha@e risen to such n point, that I feel disposed to urge you to a private marriage, dnring your father's absenee.'' e Oh, no, Auriol; much as I lore yon, I conld never consent to seuch a step,'' she eried. 4 Yon cannot urge me to il. I wonld not ab@se my deuar fnther'se trusting love. -I ha@o n@oer deeeived him, and that is the best assuran@ec I can give you that I shall never deeei@e you.'' Further conversation was interrupted by the entran@es EDITR TALBOT. 147 of Mr, Talbot, who held out both his hands to Auriol, and professed the greatest delight to see him. And no doubt he was sincere. The dinner passed off most pleasantly, and so did the evening; for the old gentleman was in high spirits, and his hilarity was communicated to tha yo@ng conple. When Auriol and Mr. ITalbot went up@stairs to teas, they found that Editl's aunt, Mrs. Maitlanl, had arri@ed to take charge of her during her fuather's absence. This lady had always exhibited a partiality for Auriol, and had encouraged his suit to her niece; consequently she was well satisfied w@th tle turn affairs had taken. It was near midnight before Auriol conld tear himself away; and when ho rose to depart, Mr. Talbot, who had yawned frequently, bnt fruitlessly, to gi@e him@a hint, told him he might depend upon seeing him back on the evening of the third day, and in the mean time he committed him to the care of Mrs. Maitland and Edith. IThree days flew by rspidly and delightfully; and on the evening of the last, just as the little party were assembled in the drawing-room, after dinner, Mr. T@lbot returned from @his journey. @Well, here I am 1'' he ecried, clasping Edith to his bosom, `` without ha@ing encountered any misadventure.

And now let us change the subject.'' Mr. Talbot seated himself beside Mrs. Maitland, and] began to give her some aec@@nt of his journey, which appeared to have been as pleasant as it had been rapid.

Indeed, I have no doubt of it@' e Nor I,--if I ever possess her,'' mentally ejaculatod Auriol. The morning psssed in other preparations. In the e@ening the lo@ers met as usual, and separated with tha full persuasion, on Edith's pasrt at least, that the next day wonld make them happy. Bince the night of the compset, Auriol had neither seen Iougemont, nor heard from him, and ho negleeted no precaution to prevent his intrusion. @@@@@-1@5@@@0 @@@@@AU@RIOI. Ir was a delicious morning in May, and the sun shone brightly on Auriol's gorgeous equipage, as he droro to St. George's, Iano@er-square, where he was united to Edith. Thns far all seemed auspicious, and he thought he could now bi@d defiance to fate. With the object of his lo@e close beside him, and linked to him by the strongest and holiest ties, it seemed impossible she could bo snatched from him. Nothing occurred during the morning to give him uneasiness, and he gare orders that a carriage and four should bo reaiy an honr before midnight, to conrey him and his brida to Richmond, whoere they were to spend their honeymoon. Night came, and with it began to arrive tho guests who were bidden to the ball. No expense had been spared by Auriol to give splendour to his fete. It was in all respeets magnificent. Tho amusements of the evening commenced with a concert, which was performed by the first singers from the lItalian Opera; after which, the ball was opened by Auriol and his lovely brido. As soon as the dance was over, Auriol made a sign to an attendant, who instantly disappeared. @Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me, Edith 7'' he assked, with a hcart swelling with rapture. -=e==---e======--==--x----==-e =nLL O a , , h i9 a T iII 1 , 111 2 1 11 g ] 1 1 xL 1 -sI ee.] 3l.

Elith arose, ant passing her arm nnder that of her husband, they quitted the ball-room, but in place of descending the principal staircase, they took a more private course. Tho hall, which they were obliged to cross, and which they enterel from a side-door, was spacious and boautifully proportioned, and adorned with nnmerous statnes on pedestals, The ceiling was decorated with fresco paintings, and supported by two stately scagliola pillars. From between these, a broad staircase of white marble ascended to the upper room. As Auriol had forcseen, the stairease was thronged with guests ascending to the bnll-room, the doors of which bceing open, afforded glimpses of the dancers, and g@se forth strains of liveliest music. Anxious to a@oid a ncwly-arrived party in tha hall, Auriol and his bride lingered for a moment near a pillar. @Ha1 who is this'' cried Edith, as a tall man, with a sinister countenance, and habited entirely in black, moved from tle fartler side of tho pillar, and plantod himself in their path, with his back partly towards them. A thrill of apprehension passed through Auriol's frame. Ie looked up and beheld Rougemont, who, glancing ovrer lis shoulder, fixed his malignant gaze npon him.

M@. T@o@n@xcnorT and his companions had scarcely g@ined s passago in tho deserted house, which they had entered in the manner deseribed in a previous chapter, when they were alarmed by the sudden and furious ringi@g of a bell overhead. The noise bronght them instantly to a halt, and each man graepod his arms in expectation of an attack, but the peal ceasing in a few moments, and all oontinuiug q@iet, they mored on as before, and presently reached s large hall with a lofty window over the door, which, being witlout shutters, affordad light enough to roveal the dilapilated condition of tho mansion. From this hall four side doors opened, apparently communicating with differont chambers, threo of wlich were cautionsly tried by Reeks, but they pro@ed to be fastened. Tho fourth, howerer, yieldod to @is toueh, and admitted them to a chamber, whioh seemed to have been recently oceupied, for a lamp w@s burning within it. Thoe walls were panelled with dusky oak, and hung at the lower end rHRE OELL. 155i with tspestry, representing tbe Assyrian monareh Ninns, and lis captive Zoroaster, @ing of the Bactrians. Tha chief furniture consisted of three large high-backed and grotesquely-carved arm-chairs, near one of which stood a powerful electrical machine. fquares and circles were traced upon the floor, and here and there were scattered cups and balls, and other matters apparently belonging to a conjuring apparatns. The room might be the retreat of a man of science, or it might be the repository of s juggler. But whoever its occupant was, and whatsoever his pursnits, the good things of the world were not altogether neglected by him, as was pro@ed by a table spread with viands, and furnishod with glasses, together with a couple of taper-necked bottles. While glancing upwards, MIr. Thorneyeroft remarked that just above each chair the ceiling was pierced with a ronnd hole, the meaning of whioh he could not at the time comprehend, though after circumstances sufficiently explained it to him. 4 A singular room,'' he obser@ed to Reeks, on ooncluding his surrey. @Did you expect to find any one here ?'" @I hardly know,'' replied the other. @That bell may have given the alarm.

Ho next crossed the hall, and cautiously ascending a staircase at the farther end of it, reached the landing-plaee. Beyond it wss a gallery, from which several chambers opened. rEE CELL. 1sI1 Advancing a few paces, he listened intently, and hearing a slight sonnd in an apartment to the right, he stepped softly towards it, and placing his eye to the keyhole, beheld s tall man, dressed i@ black, pacing to and fro with rapid strides, while three other persons, wrapped in sable gowns, and disguised with hideous masks, stood silent and motionless at a little distanee from him. In the tall man he reeognised Cyprian Rongemont. Upon a table in the middlo of the room was laid a large open volume, bound in black vellum. Near it stood a lamp, which servred to illumine the scene. ]Suddenly, Rougemont stopped, and turning over se@eral leaves of the book, which were covered with cabalistio characters, appeared in search of some magic formula. Before he could find it, howe@er, a startling interruption occurred. An alarum-bell, fixed against the wall, began to ring, and at the same moment the doors of a cabinet flew open, and a large ape (for snch it seemed to Reeks), clothod in a woollen shirt and drawers, sprang forth, and bounding upon tho table beside Rougemont, placed its mouth to his ear. The comumunication thus strangely made seemed highly displeasing to Rongemont, who knitted his browe, and delivered some instructions in an under tone to the monkey. The animal nodded its heasd in token of obedience, jumped off the table, and bo@nded back to the cabinet, the doors of which elosed as before. Rougemont next took up the lamp, with the evident intention of quit 158 ting the room, seeing which, Reeks hastily retreated to an udjoining chamber, the door of which was fortunately open, nnd hsd ecarcely gained its shelter when the fonr mysterions personages appeared on tho gallery. Reeks heard their footsteps descending the staircase, and then, creeping cautionsly after them, watched them across the hall, and pause before the chamber containing Mr. Thorneycroft and his companions. After a moment@s' deliberation, Rougemont noiselessly locked the door, took out the key, and lea@ing two of his attendants on guard, returned with the third towards the staircase. Without tsrrying to confront them, Reeks started back, and hnrried along the gallery till he came to s back staircase, which condncted him, by varions descents, to the basement floor, where, after tra@ersing one or two vanlts, he entered a subterranean passage, arched overhead, and having se@eral openings at the sides, apparently commnanicating with other passsges. It was lighted at interrals by lamps, which emitted a feeble rsdianee. By the light of one of these, Reeks discovered the door of a cell. It was of iron, and as ho struck it@with his hand, retnrned a hollow clangour.

The noise, which up to this moment had borne an indistinct resemblance to the creaking of whceels and pulleys, now increased to a violent clatter, while the house was shaken as if by the explosion of a mine beneath it. At the same time, the occnpanta of the chairs received a sharp electrical shock, that agitated every limb, and caused Mr. Thorneyeroft to let fall lis pistol, which went off as it reached the ground. At the same time, the Sandman dropped his goblet, and the Tinker relinquished his grasp of the cutlass. Before they could recover from tha shock, all three were caught by stout woolen hooks, which, detaching themselves from the back of the chairs, pinioned their arms, while their legs were restrained by fetters, which sprang from the ground and clasped round their ankles. Thus fixed, they struggled @ainly to get freo. The chairs 168 AUnIOL. seemed nailed to the gronnd, so that all efforts to move them proved futile. But the worst was to come. From the holes in the ceiling already alluded to, descended three he@sy bell-shaped helmnets, fashioned like those worn by divers at the bottom of the sea, and having round eyelet-holes of glass. It was e@ident, from the manner of their descent, that thes@ helmets must drop on the heade of the sitters-a conviction that filled them with inexpressible terror. They shouted, and swore frightfully ; but their vociferations availed them nothing. Down came the helmete, and the same moment, the monkey@ which had been seen by Reeks@ issued from a cnpboard at the top of a cabinet, and grinned and gibbered at them. Down came the first helmet, and eovered the Tinker to the shoulders. His appearance was at once ludicrous and terrible, and his roaring within the casque sounded like tha bellowing of s baited bull. Down came the seeond helmet, though rather more slowly, and the Sandman was eclipsed in the same manner as thc T@nker, and roared as loudly. In both these instances the helmets had dropped without g@idance, bat in the csse of Mr. Thorneyeroft, a hand, thrust out of the hole in the ceiling, held the helmet suspended o@er his head, like the sword of Damocles.

He had scarcely spoken, wlen the helmet fell with a jerk, and exstinguished hin like the others. Ginger alone remained. During the whole of this strange scene, he had stood with the bottle in hand, transfixed with terror and astonishment, and wholly unable to mo@e or cry out. A elimax was put to his fright, by the descent of tho three chairs, with their occupants, through the floor into a vault beneath; and as the helmets were whisked up again to the ceiling, and the trap-doors closed upon the chairs, he dropped the bottle, and fell with his face upon the table.

He lookel round for his companions in misfortnne, but, thongh the chairs were there, they were unoccupied.

His dark brown hair hung about his face in elf-locks, his benrd was untrimmed, and a fixod and stony glnro like that of insanity sat in his eye. He was scated on the ground-ncithor bench nor stool being allowed him-with his hand supporting his chin. His gaze was fixed npon vacancy-if that can be enlled vacsney, which to him was filled with vivrid images. His garb was not thnat of modern times, but consisted of a doublet and hose of rich material, wrought in the fashion of Elizabeth's days.

Its lurid glimmer partially illumined the chamber, and showed that it wus bunilt of stone. Rude benches of antique form were set about the vault, and motioning Auriol to be seated upon one of them, Rougemont sounded a silver whistle. The summons wss shortly afterwards answered by the dwarf, in whose attire as new change had taken place.

Sir Lionel Flamstead. I have called it a dining-room, from its ordinary application to the purposes of refection and festivity; but it had much more the air of a library, or study. It was s small comfortable chamber, just large enough to contain half a dozen people, though by management double that number had been occasionally squeezed into its narrow limits. The walle were decorated with curious old prints, maps and plans, set in old black wormeaten frames, and representing divers personages, places, and structures connected with London and its history. I Oser the mantelpiece was stretehed Vertne's copy of alph Aggas's famous survey of our ``great metropolis,'' made abont the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, or perhaps z little earlier, when it was scarcely so great a metropolis as at the present time, and when novelists, gentlemen of the press, cabmen, omnibus cads, and other illustrious personages were unborn and undreamced of; when St., Giles's, in lieu of its mysterious and Dedalian Seren Dials (which fSeen''), consisted of a little cluster of country houses, surroundel by a grove of elms; when a turreted wall girded in the City, from Aldgate to Grey Friars; when a pack of stag-hounds was kept in Finsbury-fields, and archers and cross-bowmen haunted the purlieus of the Spital; when he who strolled westward from Charing-cross (then no misnomer) beheld neither Opera House nor club-house, buta rustic lane, with a barn at one end, and a goodly assortment TE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. 209 of hay-cnrts and hay-stacks at the other; when the Thames was crossed by a single bridge, and that bridge looked like a street, and tho street itself like as row of palaces. On the right of this plan hung a asketch ot WIl Somers, jester to Henry VIII., after the picture by Holbein; on the left an engraving of Geoffrey Hudson, the diminutive attendant ot Henriettas Maria. This niche was deoted to portraits of the bluff king before mentioned, and his six spouses; that to the melancholy Charles and his family. Here, thoe Grent Fire of 1666, with its black profiles of houses, relieved by a sheet of '` bloody and malicious'' flame, formed as pleasant contrast to the icy wonders of tho Frost Fair, held on the IThames in 1684, when carriages wero drien through the lines of tents, and an ox was roasted on the water, to the infinite deleetation of the citizens. There Old Saint Paul'a (in the words of Vietor Hugo, `' one of those Gothic monuments so admirable and so irreparable''), and which is but ill replaced by the modern ``' bastard connterpart'' of the glorious fane of St. Peter at Rome, reared its venerable tower (not dome) and lofty spire to the sky. Next to St. Paul's came the reverend Abbey of Westminster, taken before it had been disfigured by the towers adde by Wren; and next to the abbey opened the long and raftered vista of its magnificent neighbouring hall.

Bcareely an old edifice, to which an historicnl tradition could be attached (and what old London edifics is destitute of such traditions7), was wanting. Nor were the great of old--the spirits, who gave interest and endurance to these decayed, or decaying structures, wanting. But I shsll not pause to enumerate their portraite, or make out a catalogue as long as the list of Homer's slips, or the gallery of Mr. Lodge. Sufficient has been said, I trust, to give the reader an idea of th physiology of the room. Yet stay1 I must not omit ta point ont the ocontents of those groaning shelves. In the goodly folios crowded there are contained the chronicles of Holinshed and Hall; of Grafton, Fabian, and Stow; of Mathew of Paris, and his namesake of Westminster. Let him not be terrified nt the ponderous size of these sdmirable old historians, nor be deterred by the black letter, if he honld chance to open a volume. Their freshness and picturesque details will surprise as mueh as they will delight him. From this wealthy miue Shakspeare drew some of his purest ore. The shelves are crowned by a solitary bust. It is that of a modern. It is that of a loer of London, and a character of London. It is Docros onxso. Haring completed the survrey of the apartment, I shall now proceed to its oecupants.

They were in the full low of fun and conviviality; enjoying themsolves as good follows always enjoy themselves at `'` the season of the year.'' The port was delectable-old as Saint Paul's, I was going to say-not quite, however-but just `` old enough;'' the claret was nectar, or, what is better, it was Lnfitte; tho punch was drink for the gods. The jokes of this party would hae split your sides--their laughter wonld have had the senme effect on your ears. Neer were henrd peals of merriment so heuarty and prolonged. You only wondered low they found time to drink, so quick did each roar follow on the heels of its predecessor. That they did drink, howcver, was clear; that they had drunk was equally certain; and that they intended to continue drinking seemed to come within tho limits of probability. Sir Lionel Flamstead was a retired merchant-one of those high-souled, high-principled traders, of whom our City was onee so justly proud, and of whom so few, in these days of railway bubbles, and other harebrained speculations, can bo fonnd. His word was his bond-once passed, it was sufficient; his acceptances wcre acoounted safe as the Bank of England. Had Sir Thomas Greslam desecended from his niche he could not havo been treated with greater consideration than attended ir Lionel's appearance on 'Chnge.

Affable, yet precise, and tinetnrel nE OLD LONDON IERCLAYT. 213 with something of the punctilionsness of the old school, his manners won him universal respect and regard, een from those unknown to him. By his intimates he was revered. His habits were as regular as cloekwork, and the glass of cold punch at Tom's, or the basin of soup at Birch's, wound him up for the duy. His attire was as formal as his manners, being a slight modification of the prealent costume of some fie-and-thirty years ago. He had consented, not without extreme reluctance, to clothe his nether limbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction; but he resolutely adhered to the pigtail. There is something, by-the-by, in a pigtail, to which old gentlemen cling in spite of all remonstrance, with lover-like pertinacity. Only hint the propriety of cutting it off to your great-unecla or your grandfather, and you may rely on being cut off with s shilling yoursolf. Be this as it may, Sir Lionel gnthered his locks, once sable as tho riband that bound tlem, but now thickly strewn with the sileer blossomns of the grave,' into a knot, and suffered them to dangle a few inches below his collar. His shoes shone with a lustre beyond French polish, and lis hat was brushed till not a wind dared to approach it. Sir Lionel wore a white, unstarched cravat, with a tbick pad in it, sported a frill over his waistcoat, carricd a black ebony cane in his hand, and was generally followed by s pet pg-dog, one of tha most sgacious and disagreeable speeimens of his species. Sir Lionel Flamstead, I have said, was tall-I might have said he was very tall-some214 TE oLD LODON ERCANT. what narrower across the shoulders than ahout the hips-a circumstance which did not materially conducee to his symmetry-with grey, benevrolent eyes, shaded by bnshy, intelligent brows-a lofty, expansive forehead, in which, in tho jrgon of phreuology, the organs of locality and ideality were strongly deeloped, and which was rendered the more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on either sido of the temples-with a nose which had been considered handsome and well proportioned in his youth, but to which good living had imparted a bottle form and a bottle tint-and cheeks from which all eneroachment of whiskers was sedulonsly removed, in order, we conclude, that his rosy eomplexion might be traced from its point of concentration, upon the prominent featnre befere mentioned, to its final disappearance behind his ears. Such was Sir Lionel Flamstead. --'7 A NII3 ADYENIURB I 0IE.

Ths Gray Botle, Caxona to be in Rome in the Angst of 1830, 1 visited the gorgeous church of anta Maria Maggiorse during the celebration of the anniversary of the HBoly Assumption. It was a glorious sight to one nnaceustomed to the imposing religious ceremonials of the Romish chureh, to wit216 A NIGII's ADVETURE N ROIE. ness all tho pomp and splendour displayed at this high eolemnity-to gaze down that glittering pile, and mark the various ecclesiastical dignitaries, eneh in their peculiar and] characteristio costume, employed in the ministration of thcir sncred functions, and snrrounded by a wide semicircle of theI papal guards, so stationed to keep back the crod, and who, with teir showy scarlet attire and tall halberds, looked like the martial figures we see in the sketches of Cnllot. Nor was the brilliant effeet of this picture diminished by the sumptuous framework in which it was set. Oerhead flamed a roof resplcndent with burnished gold; before me rose a canopy supported by pillars of porphyry, nnd shining with many-coloured stones; while on either hand were chapels devoted to some noble house, and boasting each the marble memorial of a pope. Melodious masses proper to the service were ever and anon chanted by the papal choir, and oerpowering perfume was diffused around by a hundred censers. Subdued by the odounrs, the music, and the spectaele, I sank into a state of dreamy enthusiasm, during a continuance of which I almost fancied myself a convert to the faith of Rome, and surrendered myself nnreflectingly to an admiration of its errors. As lI gazed among the surrounding crowd, tho sight of so many prostrate figures, all in attitudes of deepest deotion, satisfied me of the profound religious impression of the ceremonial. As elsewhere, this feeling was not nniversal; anl, as elsewhere, likewise, more -- A NIGET's ADETUE IN ROME. 217 zeal was exhibited by the lower than the higher classes of society; and I occasionally noted amongst the latter thae glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom, not altogethcr agitated, I suspect, by holy aspirastions. Yet methought, on the whole, I had never scen such abandonment of sonl, such prostration of spirit, in my own colder clime, and during the exerciso of my omn more chastened creed, as that wlich in several instances I now beheld; and I almost envied the poor maiden near me, who, abjeet upon the earth, had washed away her sorrows, and perhaps her sins, in contrite tears. As such thoughts swept through my mind, I felt a plessure in singling ont particnlar figures and groups which interested me, from their peculiarity of costume, or from their deotional feronr. Amongst others, a little to my left, I remarked a band of mountaineers from Calabria, for such I judged them to be from their wild and picturesque garb. Deeply wass every individual of this little knot of peasantry impressed by tho ceremonial. Every eye was humbly cast don; every knee bent; erery hand was either occupied in grasping the little crucifix suspended from its owner's neck, in telling the beads of his rosary, or foervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast While gazing upon this group, I chanced upon an individual whom I had not litherto noticed, and who now irresistibly attracted my attention. Thogh a little remoed from the Cualabrian mountaineers, and reclining against tha 218 A NIGn' ADENTURE N BOME. marble walls of the church, he eidently belongcd to tha same company; at least, so his attire seemed to indicate, though the noble cast of his countenance was far superior to that of his comrades. He ws an old man, with a face of the fine antique Roman stamp-a bold outline of prominent nose, rugged and imperious brow, and proudly-cut chin. His head and chin, as well as his naked breast, were frosted over with the snowy honours of many winters, and their hosr appearance contrasted strikingly with the tawny hue of a skin almost as dark and as lustronus as polished onk. Pensant as he was, there was somcthing of grandenr and msjesty in this old man's demeanour and physiognomy. IHis head declined backwards, eo as completely to expose his long and muscular throat. His arms hung listlessly by his side; one hand drooped upon the pavement, tlo other was placed within his breast: his eyes were closed. Tha old man's garb was of the coarsest fabric; he woro littlo beyond a slirt, a loose vest, a sort of sheep-skin cloak, and canvaes leggings bound around with leathern thongs. His appearance, however, was aboo his condition; he became his rags as proudly as a prince would have become his ermined robe. The more I serutinised the rigid lines of this old man's oonntenance, the more I became satisfied that many singular, and perhaps not wholly guiltless, erents were conneeted with his history. The rosary wass in his hand-tha eross upon his breast-the beads were untold-the orucifi ----A MIGRT's ADYETRE IR ROE. 219 nnelasped-no breath of prayer passed his lips.

The musie was hushed, tha robed prelates and their train had disappeared, joyous dames were hastening along the marble aisles to their eqnipages; all, save a few kneeling figures near the chapels, were departing; and the old man, aware, from the stir and hum prevailing around, that the ceremonial was at an end, arose, stretched ont his arm to one of his comrades, a youth who had joined him, and prepared to follow the concourse. Was he really blind? Aasuredly not. Besides, he did not walk like as one habitauated to the direst calamity that can befal onr nature. He staggered in his gait, and reeled to and fro. Yet wherefore did he not venture to unclose his eyes within the templo of the Most High7 What would I not hae gien to be made aequainted with his history I For I felt that it must be as singular one. I might satisfy my cnriosity at once. He was moving slowly forwasrd, guided by his comrade. In a few seconds it wonld be too late-he wonld have vnnished from my sight. With hasty footsteps I followed him dow the] 220 A NIGT's DYENTURE IN ROME. church, and laid my hand, with somne violence, upon his shoulder. Tho old man started at tha touch, and turned. Now, indeed, his eyes were opened wide, and flashing full upon me,-and such eyesl Heretofore I had only dreamed of snch. Age had not quenched their lightning, and I quailed beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me. But if I was, at first, surprised at the display of anger which I had called forth in him, how much more was I astonished to behold the whole expression of his countenance suddenly change. His eyes eontinued fixed upon mine as if I had bheen a basilisk. Apparently ho eonld not aert them; while his whole frame shiered with emotion. I adanced towards him; he shrank backwards, and, but for the timely aid of his companion, would hsve fallen upon the paeIment. At a loss to conceie in what way I could have occasioned him so much alarm, I rushed forward to the assistance of the old man, when his son, for such it subsequently auppeared he was, radely repelled me, and thrust his hand into his girdle, as if to seek for means to prevent further interference. Meanwhile the group had been inereased by the arrial of a third party, attracted by the cry the old man had uttered in falling. The new comer was an Italian gentleman, somewhat stricken in years; of stern and stately deportment, and with something rinister and forbidding in his A NIGRT' ADYENTURE I ROE. 221 aspect. Ho was hastening towards the old man, bat ha suddenly stopped, and was abont to retire when he encountered my gaze. As our eyes met he started; and a terror, as sudden and lisely as that'exhibited by the old man, was at once depicted in his features. My surprise was now beyond all bonnds, nnd I continuod for some moments speechless with astonislnent. Not a little of the inexplicable awe which affected the oll man and the stranger was communicated to myself. Altogether, we formed a mysterions and terrible triangle, of which ech side bore some strange and unintelligible relation to the other. The new comer first recovered his eomposure, though not without an effort. Coldly turning his heel upon me, he walked towards the old mnn, and shook him forcibly. The latter shrank from his grasp, and endeavoured to uoid him; but it was impossible. The stranger whisperel a few words in his ear, of which, from his gestures being directed towards myself, I oould guess the import. The old man replied. His action in doing so wass that of supplication and despair. The stranger retorted in a wild and vehement manner, and oeren stamped upon the ground; but the old man still eontinued to oling to the knees of his superior.

Io was gone; none of the bystanders who had seen him go forth knew whither.

Ox the same night I bent my steps towards tle Colosseum; and, full of my adventure of the morning, found nyself, not without apprehension, involed within its labyrinthine passages. Accompanied by a monk, who, with a small horn lantern in his hand, acted as my guide, I fanied that, by itas uneertain light, I could discover stealthy fgures lurking within the shades of the ruin. Whatever suspicions I might entertain, I pursued my course in silenee. Emerging from the vomitorio, we stood upon the steps of the colossal amphitheatre. The huge pilo was bathed in rosy moonlight, and reared itself in serene majesty before my view. While indulging in a thousand speculations, occasioned by the hour and the spot, I suddenly perceived a figure on a point of the ruin immediately above me. Nothing but tho head was visible; but that was placed in bold reliei 226 A NIGET' ADVEYTOE IN OE. against tho beaming sky of night, and I recognised it at once. No nobler Roman head had eer graced the circns when Rome was in her zenith. I shouted to the old Calabrian, for he it was I beheld. Almost ere the sound had left my lips, he had disappeared. I made known what I had seen to the monk. He was alarmed-urged our instant departure, and advised me to seek the assistance of tho sentinel stationed at the entrance to the pile. To this proposal I assented; and, having descended tho vasty steps and crorced the open arena, we arried, without molesta tion, at the doorway. The sentinel had allowed no one to pass him. He returned with me to the circus; and, after an ineffiectual search amongst tho ruins, olunteered his services to accompany me homewards throug the Forum. I declined his offer, and shaped my course tovards a lonesome vicolo on the right. This was courting danger; but lI cared nt, nnd walked lowly forward through the deserted place. Scarcely had I proceeded many paces, when I henrd footsteps swiftly approaching; and, ere I could tun round, my arms wero seizcd from behind, and a bandsge was passed across my eyes.

We walked for it might be half an honr, mnch beond the walls of Rome. I had to scramble through many ruins, and frequently stumbled oer inequalitics of ground. I now felt the fresh brecze of night blowing over the wide campagna, and my condactors moved swiftly onwards as we trod on its elastie turf. At length they came to a halt. My bandags was removed, and I beheld myself beneath the arch of an aqueduct, which spanned the moonlit plain. A fire was kindled beneath the arch, and the ruddy flame licked its walls. Aronnd the blaze were groped the little band of peasantry I had beheld within th church, in varions and picturesque attitudes. They greeted my conductors on their arrival, and glanced inquisitisely at me, but did not speak to me.

Strangel'' he muttored; adding, with a grim smile, but, however, likenesses are easily accountoed for,'' hat likenesses 2'' I asked. ee Whom do I resemble 7 and what is the motie of your inexplicable conduet 2 e You shall hear,'' he replied, frowning gloomily. Step nside, and lct us get within the shade of these arcehes, out of the reach of yonder listeners. The tale I hae to tell is for your ears alone.'' I obeyed him; and we stood beneath the shadow of the nqueduct. Years ago,'' began the old mn, ` an Englishman, in all respeets resembling yourself, equally well-favoured in person, and equally young, came to Rome, and took up his nbode within the eternal city. He was of high rank in his own country, and wns treated with the distinction due tu his exalted station here. At that time I dwelt with the MIarchese di-. I was his confidential serrant-his adviser-his friend. Ihad lived with his father-carried him ns an infant-sported with him as a boy-lored and served im as a man. Lovod him, I say; for, despite his treatment of me, I loved him then as much as I abhor him now. Welll signor, to my story. If his youth had been profligate, his manhood was not less depraed; it was devoted to eold, calculating libertinism. Soon after he sneceeded to the estates and title of lis father, hoe msrried. Thnt he A MaRs ADENTURE IN ROE. 229 loved his bride, I can scarcely believe; for, though he was wildly jealous of her, he was himself unfaithful, and she knew it. In Italy, reenge, in such cases, is easily within a woman's power; and, for anght I know, the marchesa might have meditated retaliation. My lord, however, took the alarm, and thought fit to retire to his villa without the city, and for a time remained seeluded within its walls. It was at tlis crisis that tha Englishman I have before mentioned arrived in Rome. My lady, who mingled little with the gaietios of the city, had not beheld him; but she eould not have been unacquainted with him by report, as every tongue was loud in his praises. A rumour of his suecesses with other dames had renched my lord; nay, I have reason to beliese that he had been thwarted by the handsome Englishman in some other quarter, and he sedulously prevented their meeting. An interiew, howeer, did take place betwveen them, and in an unexpected manner. It was the custom then, as now, upon particular occasions, to drive, during the heats of summer, within the Piazzs Navona, which is flooded with water. One evening tho marchesa droe thither: she was unattended, except by myself. Our carriage happened to be stationed near that of the young Englishman,'' The mnarchesa was beantiful, no doubt '' I said, interrapting him. MIost beantiful'' he replied; `' and so your countryman seemel to think, for he was lost in admiration of her. 230 A NIGIIT's ADENTURE IN OIE. I am not much ersed in the language of the eyes, bnt his wero too oloquent and expressive not to be understood. I watched my mistress narroly. It was eident from her glowing cheek, though her eyes were cast down, that she was not insensible to his regards. She turned to play with her dog, a lovely little greyhound, which was in the carriage beside her, anl pattel it carelessly with the glovo wlich she held in her hand. The animal snatched the glove from her grasp, and, as he bounded backwards, fell oer the carriage side. MIy lady uttered a scream at the sight, and I was preparing to extrieate the struggling dog, when tha Englishman plunged into the water. In an instant he had restored her favourito to the marchesa, and receied her warmest acknowledgments. From that noment an intimacy commenced, which was destined to produce the most fatal consequcneces to both parties.'' Did yon betray them 1'' I asked, somewhat impatiently. e I was then the blind tool of the marchese. I did so,'' repliel the old man. I told him all particulars of tho interviow. Ile henrd me in silence, bnt grew ashy palo with suppressed rage. Bidding me redouble my vigilanee, he left me. MIy laly was now scnrcely ever out of my sight; when one evening, a few days after what hsd occurred, she walked forth alone npon the garden-terrace of the villa. Her guitar was in her hand, and her favourite dog by her side. I was at a little distance, but wholly nnperceived. She struck a few plaintive chords upon her LLILLLLLLL A NIGIII's ADYENTUE IN ROYB. 231 instrument, and then, resting her chin npon her white and rounded arm, seemed lost in tendoer reerie. Wonld you had seen her, signor, as I beheld her then, or as one other bochold herl you would acknowledgoe that you had neve met with her oqual in beauty. Her raven hair fell in thick tresses oer shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most perfect proportion. Her deep dark eyes were thrown languidly on the ground, and her radiant features wero charged with an expression of profound and pensie passion. In this musing attitude she continued for some minutes, when she wss aroused by the gambolse of her dog, who bore in his mouth a glove which he had found. As she took it from him, a letter dropped upon the floor. Iad a serpent glided from its folds, it could not hae startled her more. She gazed upon the paper, offended, but irresolute. Yes, sho was irresolute; and you may conjecture the rest. Sho paused, and by that pause was lost. With a shrinking grasp she stooped to raiso the letter. Her cheeks, which had grown deathly pale, again kindled with blushes as she perused it. She hesitated-cast a bewildering look towarls the mansion-placed tho note within her bosom-and plunged into the orahge-bower.'' Hor loer awaited hoer there 7'" He did. I saw them mcet. I heard his frenzied words --his passionate entreaties. He urged her to fly-she resisted. He grew more urgent-more impassioned. Sha nttered a faint cry, ahnd I stool before them. The English. 232 A MIGRTs ADYETURE IN ROME. man's hand was at my throat, and his sword at my breast, with the swiftness of thought; and but for the screams of my mistress, that instant must hae been my last. At her desiro he relinquished his hold of me; but her cries had reached other ears, and the marehese arried to aenge his injured honour. He paused not to inquire th nature of tho ofence, bat, sword in hand, assailed tho Englishman, bidding me remoe his Iady. The clash of their steel was drownel by er shrieks as I bore her awasy; but I knew tho strife was desperate. Before I gained the house my lady had finted; and, committing her to the charge of other attendants, I returned to the terrace. I met my master alowly walking homewards. His sword was gonehis brow was bent-he shunned my sight. I knew what had happened, and did not approach him. He songht his wifte. What passed in that interview was never disclosed, but it may be guessed at from its result. That night the marchesa left her hnsband's halls-never to return. Next morn I visited the terrace where she had receied tho token. The gloe was still upon the ground. I picked it up and carried it to the marchese, detailing the whole occurrence to him. He took it, and vowed as ho took it that his vengeance shonld never rest satisfied till that gloe had been steeped in her blood.'' And ho kept hias vow 1'' I asked, shnddering. MIany montls elapsed ere its accomplishment. Italian vengeance is slow, but sure. To all ontward asppearanee, cc:: A NIORT's ADYENTURE IN oE. 233 friendship with her loer, which he did the more effectually to blind his ultimate designs. Meanwhile, time rolled on, anl the marchesa gave birth to a child-the offspring cf her sedncer,'' Great GodI'' I exelaimed, '' was that child a boy t' It was-btdt listen to me. My tale draws to a close One night, dnring the absence of the Englishman, by seeret means we entered the palazzo where tho marchesa resided. We wandered from room to room till we came to her chamber. She was sleeping, with her infant by her side. The sight maddened the marchese. He would have stricken the child, bnt I held bck his hand. He relented. IIe bade me make fast the door. H approached the bol. I hcard a rustle-a scream. A white figure sprang from out the coueh. In an instant tho light was extinguishedthere was a blow-another-und all was oer. I thre open the door. The marchese came forth. The corridor in which we stood was flooded with moonlight. A glove was in his hand-it was dripping with blood. His osth wss fulfilled-his vengeance complete-no, not complete, for the Englishman yet lived,'' What became of him 7'' I inquired. t Ask me not,'' replied the old man; `' you were at th Chiesas Santa Maria Maggiore this morning. If those stones eould speask, they might tell a fearful story.'' And that was the reason yon did not dare to nnciose -- 234 A NIGHT's ApDvENURE n ROE. yonr eyes within those holy precinetsl-a film of blood floated between yon and heaven.'' The old man shuddered, but replied not. And the child?'" I asked, after a pause;`" what of their wretched offspring 7'' It was conveyed to England by a friend of its dead father. If he were alie, that boy wonld be about your age, signor.'' Indeed I'' I said; a horrible suspicion flashing aeross my mind. After the Englishman's death,'' continued Cristofano, ` my master began to treat me with a coldness and suspicion which increased daily. I was a burden to him, and he was resolved to rid himself of me. I sparod him the trouble-quitted Rome-sought the mountains of the Abruzzi-and thence wandered to the fastnesses of Calabria, and becme-no matter what. Iera I am, Heaven'a appointed minister of vengeance. The marchese dies tonight 1' To-night l old man,'' I echoed, horror-stricken. `'Add not crime to crime. If he as indeed been guilty of thaI fonl offence you have named, let him be dealt with aceording to the offended laws of the comntry. Do not pervert the purposes of justice.'' Justice 1'' echoed Cristofano, scornfully. 'Ay, justice. You are poor and powerless, but mensI A NIGIT's ADENTRB IN ROE. 235 may be found to aid you. I will assist the rightful course of engeance.'' e on shall assist it. I have sworn he shall die before dawn, and the hand to strike the blow shall be yours.'' Mine l-never tt' Your own life will be the penalty of yonr obstinacy, if yon refuse; nor will yor refusal save him. By the Mother of Heaven, he diesl and by your hand. Yon saw how he was struck by your resemblance to the young Englishman this morning in the chiesa. It is wonderful1 I know not who or what you are; but to me you ara an instrument of vengeanee, and as such I shall use you. Tha blow dealt by you will seem the work of retribution; and I care not if you strike twice, and make my heart your second mark.'' Ere I conll reply he called to his comrades, and in a few moments we were speeding across the campagna. Wo arrived at a high wall : the old man conducted us to a postern-gate, which he opened. We entered s garden filled with orange-trees, the perfume of which loaded the midnight air. We heard the splash of a fountain at a distance, and the thrilling notes of a nightingale anongst some taller trees. The moon hung like a lamp over the belvidere of the proud villa. We strode along a wide terrce edged by a marble balustrade. The old man pointed to an open summer-house terminating the walk, and gave me a significant look, bnt he spoke not. A window thrown 236 A IGRs ADENTRE ROE. open admitted ns to the house. We were within a haIl orowded with statues, and traversed noiselessly its marble floors. Passing through seeral chambers, we then mounted to a corridor, and entered an apartment which formed the ante-room to another berond it, Placing his finger npon his lips, and making a sign to his comrades, Cristofana opened a door and disappeared. Thero was a breathless pause for a few minutes, during whieh I listened intently, but caught only a faint sound as of the snapping of a loek. Presently the old man retnrned. Ie sleeps,'' he said, in a low deep tone to me; ' sleeps as his victim slept-sleeps withont a dream of remorse; and he shall awaken, as she awoke, to despair. Come into his chamber t Woe obeyed. The door was made fast within side. The curtains of the couch were withdrawn, and the moonlight streamed full upon the face of the sleeper. He was hushed in profound reposo. No visions seemed to haunt his peaceful slumbers. Could guilt sleep so soundly1 I half donbted tho old man's story. Placing us within the shadow of the canopy, Cristofano approached the bed. A stiletto glittered in his hand. Awake l'' he cried, in a voice of thunder. The sleeper started at the summons. I watehed his countenance. He read Cristofano's errand in his eye. But he quailed not. A NIGT's ADvELNTDRE IN ROYB. 237 e Cowardly assassin 1'' he cried, `' you have well consultod your own safety in stealing on my sleep.' And who taught me the lesson 1'' fiercely interrupted the old msn. Am I the first that hae stolen on midnight slumber7 Gazo upon this7 When and how did it acquire its dye ?'' And he held forth a glovre, which looked blackened and stained in tho moonlight. The marehese groaned aloud. My cabinet broken openl'' at length he oxelaimedet illainl how dared you do thisf But why do I ravre7 I know with whom I have to dcal,'' Uttering these words he sprung from his conch with the intention of grappling with the old man; but Cristofano retreatel, and at that instant the brigands, who rushed to his aid, thrust me fborward. I was face to face with the marehese. The apparition of the murderod man could not have staggered him more. His limbs were stiffened by tho shoek, and he remained in an attitude of freezing terror. eIs he come for vengeance 7'' he ejaculated. He is' cried Cristofno. Givo him the weapon.' And a stiletto was thrast into my hand. Bat I heeded not the asteel. I tore open my bosom-a small diamond cross was within the folds. e Do you recollect this 1'' I demanded of the marclese. eIt was my wite'ast'' he shrieked, in amazement. 4 It was npon the infant's bosom as he slept by her side 238A IGRTB DENTRE n ROYE. ]on that fatal night,'' ssid Cristofano. `I saw it spurkl ]there,'' That infant was myself--that wife my mother:'' I eried.

I could not strike. ee Do yon hesitate t'' angrily exclaimed Crietofamno.. e HIe has not the courage,'' returned the younger Calalrian. e Yon reproacked me this morning with want of filial duty.
