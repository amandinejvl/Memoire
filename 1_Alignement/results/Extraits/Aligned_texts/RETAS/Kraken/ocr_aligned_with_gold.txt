TuE Sixteenth Century drew to a close. It was the lsst day of tho last year, and two hours anly were wanting to the birth of another year and of anothaor century. The night was solemn and beautiful. Myriads of sta@n pa@ed the deep vnult of hea@en; the crescent moon hung like a silver lamp in the milst of them; a stream of rosy and quivrering light@ issuing from the north@ trarersed th@ sky, like the tail of some stupendous co@et; whilo from its point of effluence broke forth, ever and anon, coruscations rivalling in splendour and variety of hue the most brilliant discharge of fireworks. A sharp frost pre@ailed; but the atmosphere was clear and dry, and neither wind nor snow aggra@ated the wholesome rigour of tho season. Tho water lay in thick congealed masses around the conduits and wells, and tho buekets weroe frozen on thcir stands. Tho thoronghfares ADRIOL. were sheeted with ice, and dangerous to horsemen and vehicles; but the footways were firm and pleasant to the tread. Hero and there, a fire was lighted in the streets, round which ragged urchins and mendicants were collocted, ronsting fragments of meat stuck upon iron prongs; or qunffing deep dra@ghts of metleglin and ale, out of lenathern cups@ Crowls were collected in the open places, watching the wonders in tha hea@ens, and drawing augurics from thcm, chiefly sinister, for most of the bcholders thought the signs portended the speely death of the queen, and the alvent of a new monarch from the north-a safo and easy interpretation, considering the ad@ancet age and declining health of the illustrious Elizabecth, togcther with the kno@n appointment of her successor, Jamcs of fScotland. Notwithstanding the early halits of the times, few persons had retired to rcst, an uni@ersal wish prevailing among thc citizens to see the ncew year in, and welcome the centnry nccompanying it. Lights glimmered in most windows, revealing the holly-sprigs and lanrel-lea@cs stuck thickly in thleir diamond panes; wlile, whenever as d@or wus opened, n ruddy gleam burst across the strcet; and a glance inside the dwelling showed its inmates either gathered round tho glowing hearth, oecupicd in mirthful sports-fox-i'-th@'hole, blind-nan's-buff, or shoe-the-marc-or seated at tho @mple board grouning with Christmas checr. MInsie nnd singing were henrd at e@ery coruer, and bnnds of com@ly damsels, escorted by their sweethearts, went Irom house to honse, bearing tage brown bowls dressed ---------------------DR. LAND. with ribands and rosemary, and filled with a drink called ``lamb's-wool,'' composed of sturdy ale, smeetenel with sugar, spiced with nutmeg, and ha@ing toasts and bur@t erabs floating within it,-a dranght from which seldom brought its pretty bcarers less than a groat, and occasionally a more valuable eoin. Such wns the @igil of thoe year Sixteen Hundred. On this night, and at the tenth hour, a man of striking and venerable appearanee wns sccn to emerge upon a small wooden balcony, projecting from a bay-window near the top of a picturesque structure situated at the southcrn extremity of London-bridge. The old man's bcard and @air were as white as snow@the former descending almost to his girdle; so were th@ thick@ o@erhanging brows thmt shaded lis still piercing eyes. His forehead was high, bald, and ploughed by innumerable @rinkles. IIis countenance, despito its dentl-lika pualeness, had a noble and nsjestic cnst, ani his figure, though worn to the bone by as life of the se@erest stnu@y, @nud bent by the woight of yenrs, must hase been once lofty and commauding. His dress consisted of n doublet and hose of sad-coloured cloth, over which he wore a loose govn of blaek silk. HIis head was co@ered by a square bluck cap, from @eneath whieh his silser locks strayed o@er his shoulders. Inown by the name of Doctor Lamb, and addieted to alchemicnl and philosophical pursuits, this vrenerable personage was esteemed by the vulgar as little better than a wizard. Strange tales were reported and believed of him. n 2 3ADRIoO. Mmongst others, it was said that he possessed a familiar, because he chanced to employ a deformod, eraek-brained dwarf, who assisted him in his operations, and wlom he app@opriately enongh denominated Flapdragon. Doctor Lamb's gaze was fixed iutently upon the hea@ens, nnd he seemed to be notiug the position of the moon with referencoe to some particular star. Mfter remaining in t@is posture for a few minutes, he was about to retire, when a loud crash arrested him, and he turned to see whence it proceeded. Immeliately before him stood the Southwark Gate@ay@a equare stons building, with a ronnd, embattlod turret at enach corner, and a flat, leaden roof, planted with a forest of poles, fifteen or sixteen feet high, garnished with human henls. To his surprise, the doctor percei@ed thnt two of these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man, who was in the act of stripping th@n of their grisly burdens. Having accomplished his olject, the mysterious plunlerer thrust his spoil into a leathern bag with @hich he was provided, tied its mouth, and was about to take his departur@ by means of a rope-ladder attached to the battlements, when his retreat was suldenly cut off by the gutekeeper, armed with a halberd, and bearing a lantern, @ho issued from a door opening upon the lcads. The baffled marauder looked round, and remarking the open winlow at which bDoctor Lnmb was stationed, hurledl the sacek and its contents tlrough it. IIo then triodl to gain the ladder, but was intercepted by the gntckceper, who dealt him n s@vere blow on the head with his halberd. DR. LAMIB. Tho plunderer uttered a loud cry, and attempted to draw his sword; but before he could do so, hoe received a thrust in the side from his opponent. Ho thon fell, and the gatekeeper wonld hare repeated the blow, if tho doctor had not called to him to desist. @Do not kill him, good Baldred,'' he eried. @Th@ attempt may not be so criminal as it appears. Doubtless, the mntilatel remains which tho poor wretch has attempted to cnrry off, are those of his kindred, and horror at their exposure must have led him to commit tho offence.'' @It may be, doetor,'' replied Baldred; `` and if so I shall bo sorry I hare hurt him. Bnut I am responsible for tho snfe custody of tlese traitorous relics, and it is as much as my own hend is worth to permit their remo@al.'' @I know it,'' replied Doctor Lamb; ``and you are fully justified in what you have done. It may throw some light npon the matter, to know whose miserable remains ha@@ been disturbel.'' @They were tho heads of two rank papists,'' replied Bualdred, @who were deeapitatel on @ower Hill, on Saint Nicholas's day, three weeks ago, for conspiring against tha qucen.'' e But their names?'' demanded the doctor. @How were they called 7'' @They wero father and son,'' replied Baldred ;-: Sir Simon Darey and Master Reginald Darey. Perchan@ea t@ey were known to your worship 7'' e Too well-too well 1'' repliel Doctor Lamb, in a voice of emotion, that startled his hcarcr. @They were near l---AIoI. kinsmen of mine@own. Wh@t is he lilo wlo has mado tlis strange attempt '' @Of a rerity, a fair youth,'' rcplie1 Daldrcd, lolding down the lantern. @Iea@en grant I la@o not wounded @im to the death1 No, his heart still bcats. IIa1 hera ar@ his tablets,'' ho adled, taking a small book from his loublet; `' these may gi@e tho information you seek. Yon wero right in your conjccture, doctor. Tho namo herein inscribed is the same as that torne by tho others-Auriol Darey.'' @I sce it all,'' cried Lamb. @It was a pious and praiseworthy deed. DBring the unfortunate youth to my dwelling, Daldred, and you shall be well rcwardel. Use despatch, I pray you.'' As the gatekceper essayed to co@ply, the wonnded man groanel deeply, as if in great pain. @Fling me the wcapon with which you smoto lim,'' ericd Doctor Lamb, in accents of commiseration, `'`and I @ill anoint it @ith the powder of sympathy. IIis anguish @ill be spcelily abated.'' eI k@ow your worship can accomplish @onlers,'' oried @aldred, tlrowing the halberd into the baleony. @I @ill do my part as gently as I can.'' And as tle alclemnist taok up the weapon, and disappeared thirough the window, the gatekceper liftel tho wounded man by t@e shoulders, and conveyed him down a narrow@ winding staircase to a lower chambcr. Though ho procced@d carefully, the sufferer was put to excraciating pain; nnl when Daldred placed him en a wooden bench, and held DB. LAMD. a lsmp towards him, he percei@ed that his features wera darkened and distorted. @I fenr it's all over with lim,'' mnrmured the gatekeeper; eI @hall ha@e a dead body to take to Doctor Lamb. It wonld bo a charity to knoek him on the head, rather th@n let him suffer thus. Tho doctor passes for a cunning ma@, but if he cnn cure this poor youth without sceing him, by tho help of his sympathetic ointment, I shall begin to believe, what some folks a@ouch, that he has relations with the levil.' Whilo Baldred was rnminating in this manner, a sndden and cxtraorlinary change took place in tho suflerer. As if by mngic, the contraction of tho muscles subsided; the features assumed n wholesome hue, and the rcspiration was no longer laborious. Daldred stared as if a miracle had been wronght. Now that the countenance of tho yonth had regained its original expression, the gatekeeper could not help being struek hy its extreme beanty. The fuce was a pcrfect o@al, with regular and delicate featurces. A short silken moustache covered the uppcr lip, which was short and pr@ul, and a pointedl bearl terminated the chin. The hair was blacl, glossy, and cut short, so as to lisclose a highly intellectnal cxpanse of brow. Tho youtl's figure was slight, but atmirably proportioned. His attire consisted of a blaek satin doublet, slashed with white, hose of black silk, and a slort vel@et mantle. His eyes were still closed, and it was difficult to say what effect they might gi@e to the face when they lighted it np; but AU10L. notwithstanding its beauty, it was impossible not to admit that a strange, sinister, and almost demoniacal expression per@aded the conntenance. All at once, and with nas much suddenness as his cure had bcen effected, the young man started, uttering a pierciug ery, and placed his hand to his sido. @C@iti@f1' he cried, fixing his blazing eyes on the gatekeeper, `` why do you torture me thus? Finish me at onco -Oh@' And overeome by anguish, he sank back again. @I hasve not touched yon, sir,'' replied Baldred. e1 brought you here to succour you. You will be easier anon. Doctor L@mb must have wiped the hallerd,'' he added to limself. Another sudden change. Tho pain @led from the sufferer's countenance, and he became easy ae before. @What ha@o you done to me1'' ho asked, with a look of gratitudo; ` tlo torture of my wound has suddenly ceased, and I feel ass if a bnlm had been dropped into it. Let me remain in this state if you have any pity-or despatch me, for my late ngony was almost insupportable,'' @You are cnred for by one who hns greater skill than any chirurgeon in London,'' replied Buldred. @If I cnn manage to transport you to his lodgings, he will speelily heal your wounds.'' e Do not delay, then,'' repliel A@riol, fsintly; @fo@ though I am free from pain, I feel that my life is ebbing fast away.'' e Press this hnndkerchief to your side, nnd lean on mo,'' DB. LAMD. said Buldred. @Doctor Lamb's dwelling is but a step from the gateway-in fact, the first house on the bridge. By tho wuy, the doctor declares he is your kinsman,'' @It is the first I ever heard of lim,' replied Auriol, fuintly; "but take me to him quickly, or it will bo too late'' In another moment they were at the doetor's door. Baldred tapped against it, and tho summons was instantly a@swered by a diminutive personage, clad in a jerkin of coarse grey serge, and having a leathern apron ticd round his waist. This was Flapdragon. Blear-eyed, smoke- begrimel, lantern-javed, the poor dwarf seemed as if his whole life had been spent over the furnace. And so, in fact, it had been. He had become little better than a pair of human bellows. In his hand he hcld the halberd with which Auriol had been wounded. @So you ha@e been plasying the lcech, Flapdragon, eh7'' cried Baldred. @Ay, marry laro I,'' replied the dwarl, with a wild grin, @nd displaying na wolfish set of teeth. ' My master ordered me to smear the halberd with the sympathetic oiutment. I obeyed him; rubbed the steel point, first on one side, then on the other; next wiped it; and then smearedl it again.'' @Whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain,'' replied Baldred; ` but help me to transport him to the laboratory.'' eI know not if thoe doctor will care to be disturbod,'' said Flapdragon. @Ho is busily engaged on a grand operation.'' @I will tako the risk on myself,'' said Baldred. @Tha 10 AB:OL. youth @ill die if le remains here. Sce, he las fainted alrealy I'' Thus urged, the dwarf laid down tho halberd, and botween the t@o, Aunriol was speedily conveyed up a wide oaken staircase to the laboratory. Doctor Lamb was plying the bellows at tha furnace, on wlich a large alembic was placel, and he was so engrossel by his task, that le scnrccly noticed the entrance of the others. @@laeoe the youth on the ground, and rear his head ag@inst the chair,'' he eried, hastily, to thoe dwarf. @Batha his brows with the decoction in that crucible. I will attend to him anon. Come to me on the morrow, Ballred, and I @ill repay thee for thy trouble. I am busy now.'' @Theso relics, doctor,'' criedi the gatekee@er, glancing at the bag, which was lying on the ground, and from wiich a bald head protruded@-I ought to take them back with me.'' IIeed them not-they will be snfe in my kceping,'' cried Doctor Lamb, impaticntly; `` to-morrow-to-morrow.'' Casting a furtire glance round the laboratory, anl shrugging his slonllers, Baldrel departed; and FInpdragon la@ing bathed tho sufferer's temples with the decoction, in obelience to his mastcr's injunctions, turned to inquirs wh@t he should do next. @Degonel'' cried the doctor, so fioreoel@ that tho dwarf darted out of the room, clapping tha door after him. Doctor Lamb then applied himsolf to his task with reneved ardour, and in a few seconds became wlolly inscnsible of the presence of a stranger. n. AD. Revi@ed by the stimulant, Anriol presently opened his eyes, and gazing round the room, tlought he must be dreaming, so strange and fantastical did all appear. The floor was co@ered with the implements nsed by the adept@bolt-heads, crucibles, cucnrbites, and retorts, scattered abont without any attempt at arrangement. In one corner was a large terrestrial sphere; near it was an astrolabe; and nenar that a heap of disused glass @essels. On the other sile, lay s black, mysterions-looking book, fastened with brazen clasps. Aro@nd it, were as ram's horn, a pair of forceps, a roll of parchment, a pestle anl mortar, and a large plato of copper, gra@en with the mysterious s@mbols of the Isaicnl table. Nenr this was the leathern bag containing the two decapitated heals, one of which hal burst forth. On a table, at the farther end of tle room, stood n large open volume, with parchment leaves, covered with cabalistical characters, refcrring to the names of spirits. Ncnar it were two parchment scrolls, wvritten in letters, respectively denominated by the Challaie sages, '` the Malachim,'' and ` the Passing of the River.'' One of these scrolls was kept in its plaee by a skull. An ancient and grotesquc-looking brass lamp, with two snake-healed burners, lighted th@ room. From the @eciling depended a huge scaly sea-monster, with outspreal fins, open jaws, garnishel with tremendous teeth, and great goggling eyes. Near it hung a celestial sphere. The chimney-piece, which was curiously car@ed, and projected far inlo the room, mas laden with various implements of Hermetie science. Abo@e it were hung dried bats and flitter-mice, interspersed with the sk@lls of birds AUHIOL. and apes. Attached to the chimney-piece was a horary, sculptured in stone, near which hung a large stsr-fish. Tua fireplace was oceupied by thoe furnace, on which, as has been stated, was placed an alembic, communicating by means of a long serpentine pipe with a recei@er. Within the room were two skeletons, one of which, placed behind a curtain in the deep embrasure of the window, where its polished bones glistened in the whito moonlight, had a horriblo effect. The other enjoyed more comfortalle quarters near the chimney, its @leshless feet dangling down in the smoka arising from the furnace. Doctor Lamb, meanwhile, steadily pursned his task, though he ever and anon paused, to fling certain roots and drugs upon the clarcoal. As he did this, various-coloured flames broke forth-now blue, now green, now blood-red. Tiuged by these fires, the diflerent objects in the chamber seemed to take othoer forms, and to become instinct with animation. The gourd-shaped cucnurbites wero transformed into great bloated tonds bursting with venom; tle long@necked bolt-heade became monstrous serpents; the worm@like pipes turned into adders; the alembics looked like plumed helmets; the characters on the Isaical table, and those on the parchments, scemel traced in fire, and to be over changing; the s@a-monster bellowed and roarced, and, flapping his fins, tried to burst irom lis look; the skeletons wagged their ja@s, and raised their fleshless fingers in mockery, while blue lights burnt in their eyeless soekets; the bellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with DnB. LAB. 13 its wings; and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of the arch-fiend presiding over a witcles' sabbath. Auriol's brain reeled, and he pressed his hand to his eyes, to exclude these phantasms from his sight. But even thus they pursued him; and he imagired hoe could hear the infernal riot going on around him. Suddenly, he was roused by a loud joyful cry, and, uncovering his eyes, he behoeld Doctor Lamb pouring the contecnts of the matrass-a bright, transparent liquid-into a small phial. Having carefully secured the bottlo with a glass stopper, the old man held it towards the light, and gazed at it with rapture. `At length,'' he exclaimed aloud-'` at length, the great work is achie@ed. With the birth of tle centary now expiring I first sasw light, and the draught I hold in my hand shiall enable me to see the opening of centuries and centuries to co@e. Composed of the lunar stones, the solar stones, and the mercurial stones-preparetd according to the instructions of the Ruabbi Ben Lucca,-namely, by the separation of the pure from the impure, the volatilisation of the fixed, and the fixing of the @olatile; this elixir shall renew my youth, like that of the eagle, and give me length of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed.'' Whils thns speaking, he held up the sparkling liquid, and gazed at it like a Persian worshipping the sun. @To live for e@er1'' he cried, after a pause-`` to escape the jaws of death just when they are opening to de@our me 1-to he free from all aecidents 1-'tis a glorious 14 AIIOL. thought1 Ia1 I bethink me, the rabbi said there was one peril against whieh the elixir could not guard me-@one vulnerable point, by which, like the heel of Achilles, death might reach me1 What is i 1-where can it lie7'' And he relapsed into deep thought. IThis uncertainty will poison all my happiness,'' he continued; ` I shall li@e in constant dread, as of an invisible enemy. Dut no matterl Perpetunl lifo l-perpetual youth 1-what more ueed be desiroed 7'' @Wwhat more, indeed 1'' cried Auriol. @Ha1'' cxelaimed the doctor, suddenly recollecting the wounded man, and concealing tle phial beneath his go@n. e Yonr caution is vnin, doctor,'' snid Auriol. @I have heard whnt you havo uttered. You faney you lave discovered the olixir vit@@.'' e Fancy I have discorered it1' eried Doetor Lamb. @The matter is past all doubt. I am the possessor of thc wondrons secret, which the greatest plilosophers of all ages ha@e songht to discover--the miraculous preser@utive of tho boly against deeay.'' @The man who brought me hither told me yon were my kiusman,'' said Auriol. @Is it so t'' @It is,'' re@lied the doctor, '` and you shall now learn the co@ne@xion that subsists between us. Look at that ghastly relic,'' he added, pointing to the head protruding from the bag, " that was onco my son fSimon. His son's hend is within the sack-yonr futher's head-so that four genemations are brought together.'' @Gracious Heaven'' exclaimed the yonng man, raising DR. LAB. 15 himself on his elbon. @Yon, then, are my great-grandsire. My futher supposed you had died in his infancy. An old tale runs in the family that you were charged with sorcery, and fled to avoid the stake.'' e It is true that I fled, and took the name I bear at present,'' replied the old mnn, ``bnt I need scarcely sasy that tho charge brought against me was false. I ha@e dovoted myself to abstrusest science; ha@e held commune with tho stars; and have wrested the most hidden seerets from Nature-but that is all. T@o crimes alone have stained my soul, but both, I trust, ha@e been expiated by repentance.'' @Were they deeds of @loodt'' asked Auriol. @One was so,'' replied Darey, with a shudder. 'It was a cowardly and trcacherous deed, aggravated by the basest ingratitule. Listen, nnd yon shall hear low it chuanced. A Roman rabbi, named Ben Luccn, skilled in Hermetic science, came to this city. His fame reached me, and I sought him out, offering myself as his disciple. Ror montls, I remained with him in his laboratory-working at the furn@ee, aud poring over mystic lore. One night, he showel me that @olume, and, poiuting to a page within it, said: @Those characters contain the secret of confecting the elixir of Iife. I will now explain tlem to yon, and afterwards we will proceed to the operation.' Witl this, he unfolded the myster@; but he bade @e observe, that the menstrunm was defective on one point.

Oh, with wlat greediness I drank in his words1 How lI gazed 16 AURIO. at the mystio characters, as he explained theire import@ What @isions floated beforo me of perpetnal yontl and ene joymcnt.

Dut mark vhat followed. IIis blood fell upon the book, and obliternted tho characters; nor could I by any effort of memory reca@l the composition of the elixir.'' @When did you regain the secret 2'' asked Auriol, cnriously. @To-night,'' replied Darcy-`` within this hour. @or nigh fifty years after that fatal night I haso been making fruitlcss experiments. A film of blood has obscured my mnental sight. I have proceedel by calcitration, solution, putrefaction-ha@e produced the oils whiech will fix crudo mucrcuiry, and convert uall bodies into sol and luna; but I have over failed in fermenting the stono into the truo elixir. @1-night, it came into my hend to wash the @lood-stained @y:c coutaining the secret with a subtle liquid. I did so; @ul loubting thc efficacy of the experi@ent, left it to work, @hilo I went forth to breathe the air at my window.

At this juncture, your rash, but pious attempt DR. LAB. occurred. Having discovered our relationship, and enjoined the gatekeeper to bring yon hither, I returmaed to my old laboratory. On glancing towards the mystic volame, what was my surprise to see the page free from blood 1' Auriol uttered a slight exclamation, and gazed at the book with superstitious awe. IThe sight was so surprising, that I dropped tle sack I @ad brought with me,'' pursued Darey. @Fearful of again losing the secret, I nerved mysolf to the task, and placing fuel on the fire, dismissed my attendunt with brief injunctions relati@e to you. I then set to work. IHow I ha@e succeeded, you percei@e. I hold in my hand tho treasure I have so long sought-so eagerly coveted. ITho whole world'a wealth shonld not purchase it from me.'' Auriol gazed earnestly at his aged relative, but he said nothing. t In a few moments I shall be as full of rigour and aetivity as yourself,'' continued Darey. s We shall be no longer the great-grandsire and his descendant, but friends --companions-equals,-equals in age, strength, activity, beauty, fortune-for youth is fortnne-hal ha1 Methinks I am already yonng sgain l'' @Yon spoke of two crimes with which yonr ceonscicnee was burdened,'' remarked Auriol. @You have mentioned ]but one.'' @The other was not so foul as that I havo described,'' ]replied Darcy, in an altered tone, `` inasmuch as it wss unintentional, and oeeasioned by no base moti@e.

And, supporting himself against the furnace, he placed the phial to @is lips, and eagerly drained its contents. ITho old man seemed paralysed by the action, but kept his eye fi@ed upon the youth till he had drained the elixir to the last drop. He then nttered a piercing cry, threw up his arms, and fell heavily backwards. Dead-deadl FIlashes of light passed before Anriol's eyes, and strange noises smote his ears. For a moment he was bewildered as with wine, and laughed and sang discordantly like a madman. Every object reeled and danced around him. The glass vessels and jars clashed thoeir brittle sides together, yet remained uninjured; the furnace breathed fortl flames and mephitic @apours; the spiral worm of the alembic becname red hot, and seemed filled with molten lend; the pipe of the bolt-head ran blood; tho sphere of the earth rolled along the floor, anl rebounded from the wall as if impelled by a giant hand; the skeletons grinned and gibbered; so did the death's-head on the table; so did the skulls against the chimney; the monstrous sea-fish belched forth firo and smoke; the bald@ decapitated head opened its eyes, and .

Unable to bear these accumulated horrors, Auriol became, for a short space, insensible. On recovrering, all wns @till. The lights within the lamp had expired; but the bright moonlight, astreaming throngh tho window, fell upon the rigid features of tha unfortunato alchemist, and on the cabalistic characters of the open volume besido him. Eager to test the effect of the elixir, Auriol put his hand to his side. All traces of the wound were gone; nor did he experience the slightest pain in any other part of his body. On tho eontrary, he seemed endowed with preternatural strength. His breast dilated with rapture, and he longed to expand his joy in actire motion. Striding over the body of his aged relative, he thren open the window. As he did so, joyous peals burst from surrounding churehes, announcing the arrival of the new year. Wh@le listening to this clamour, Auriol gazed at the popnlous and picturesgue city stretched out before him, and bathed in the moonlight. @A hundred years henese,'' he thonght, `` and scarcely one soul of the thousands within those houses will he living, save myself.

L@rE one night, in the spring of 1880, two men issued .from a low, obsenrely-situated public-house, near Iiillbank, and ahaped their course apparently in the direction of Vauxhall-bridge. A@oiding the footpath near the river, they movel stealthily along toe farther sile of the road, wrhere thue opcn groun@ offerei them au easy reans of flight, in case such a course should bo found expedient. So fur as it could he disccrnol by the glimpses of the moon, which @ecasionally shone forth from a raek of hea@y clonds, the a@pearancee of these personages was not mnucl in their fa@our. IIaggard fcatures, stamped deeply with the characterse of crime and , debauehery; fierce, restless eyes; beards of several days' growth; wild, unkempt hesds of hair, formod their chief personal charaeteristics; whilo sordid and ragged clothes; shoes without soles; and old hats withiont crown@, -.nstitated the sum of their apparel, ARIOL. One of them was tall and gaunt, with large hands and foet; but despite his meagreness, he eridently possessed great strength: the other was considerably shorter, but broad-shouldered, bow-legged, long-armed, and altogether n most formidable ruffian. This fellow had high cheek@bones, a long aquiline nose, and a coarse mouth and chin, in which the animal greatly predominated. He had@a stubby red beard, with sandy hair, white brows and eyelashes. The oountenance of the other was dark and repulsive, and covered with blotches, the result of habitual intemperance. His eyes had s leering and malignant look. A. handkcerchief spotted with blood, and tied across his brow, contrasted strongly with his matted black hair, and incrensed his natural appearanc@ of ferocity. Tho shorter r@ffian carried a mallet upon his sho@lder, and his companion concealed something beneath the breast of his cost, which nfterwards proved to be a dark lantern. Not a word passed between them; but keeping a vigilant look-out, they trudged on with quick, shambling steps. A few sounds arose from the banks of the river, and there was no@ and then a plash in the water, or a distant cry, betokening some passing craft; but generally all was profonndly still. The quaint, Dutch-looking structures on the opposite bank, the line of coal-barges and lighters @oored to the strand, the great timber-yards and coal-yards, the brewhouses, gasworks, and waterworks, could only bo imperfectly discerned; but the moonlight fell clear upon th@ ancient towers of Lambeth Palace, and on the neighbouring ch@r@h. Ihe same glimmer aleo ran like a silver bel TEIE BUAED RODBE IN TIE YAUXRALL-oAD. 25] across the stream, and re@ealed the great, stern, fortress@lIike pile of the Penitentiary-perhaps the most dismal@looking structure in tho whole metropolis. The world of habitations beyond this melancholy prison were buried in larkness. The two men, however, tlought nothing of these things, and saw nothing of them; but, on arri@ing within a couple of hundred yards of the bridge, suddenly, as if by previous concert, quitted the road, and, leaping a rail, ran across a field, and plunged into a hollow formed by a dried pit, where they came to a momentary hualt. @You ain't a-been a-gammonin' me in this matter, Tinker 2' observed the shorter individual. ss The co@e'as sure to come f' @Why, you can't expect me to answer for anothoer as I can for myself, Sandman,'' replied the other; ' but if his own word's to be taken for it, he's sartin to be there.

But he can't be in his AUnIOD right mind to come to such a ken as tlat, and go on as you mentions.'' @As to that I can't say,'' replied the Tinker; `` and it don't much matter, as far as ve're consarned.'' @De@il a bit,'' rejoined the Sandman, ``except-yon'rs sure it worn't a sperrit, Tinker.

" So come along, and don't let's bo frightenin' ourselves vith ould vimen's tales.'' With tlis they emerged from tle pit, crossed the lower part of thoe field, and entered a narrow thoroughfare, skirted by a few detached houses, wlich brought them iuto tho Vauxhall-bridge-road. Here thcy kept on the side of the street most in shadow, and crosscd o@cr whcne@er they came to a lamp. By-nnd@by, two watclmen were seen ad@ancing from Belvoir-terrace, and, as the guardians of the niglt drew near, the ruflians crept into nn nlley to let t@lc pass. As soon as the coast was clcar, they ventured forth, and quickening their pnce, cnme to a row of deserted and dilapidated houscs. T@is was their destination.

These neglected dwellings served as receptacles for old iron, blocks of stone and wood, and other ponderous matters. The aspect of the whole place was so dismal and suspicious, that it was generally a@oided by passengers after nightfiall. Bkulking along the blank and dresry walls, the Tinker, who was now a little in advance, stopped hefore a door, and pushing it open, entered the dwelling. His companion followed him. Tle extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects which met the gaze of tho Sandman, coupled with the deserted appearanco of the plsce, produced an effeet upon his hardy but superstitious nature. Looking round, he beheld hnge mill-stones, enormous water-wheels, boilers of steam-engines, iron vatse, eylinders, cranes, iron pumps of the strangest fashion, a gigantie pair of wooden scales, old iron safes, old boilers, old gas-pipes, old water-pipes, cracked old bells, old bird@csges, old plates of iron, old pnlleys, ropes, and rusty chains, hnddled and heaped together in the most fantsstie disorder. In the . midst of the chaotic mass frowned the bearded and colossal head of Neptune, whieh had onee deeorated the forepart of a man-of-war. Above it, on a sort of framework, lay th@@@@@@@@a@@ @@@the@@@@@ n@@@@@@@o@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@s@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@o@e of the latter being partly demolished, and the eyes knocked in. Ab@ee these, three garden divrinities laid their heads amieably together. On the left stood a tall Grecian warrior, minns the head and right hand. The whole was surmounted by an immense @entilator, stuck on the end of ARIoL. an iron rod, ascending, like a lightning-conductor, from tha steam-engine pump. Seen by the transient light of the moon, the various objects above enumerated produced a strange effect upon the beholler's imagination. There was a mixture of the grotesque and terribloe abont them. Nor was the building itself de@oid of a certain influence npon his mind. Tho ragged brickwork, overgrown with weeds, took with him the sema blance of a human face, and seemoed to keep a wary eye on what was going forward below. A means of crossing from one side of the bnilding to tha other, without descending into the vault beneath, was afforded by s couple of plsnks; though as the wall on the farther side was some feet higher than that near at hand, and tho planks were considerably bent, the passage appeared hazardous. Glancing round for a moment, tha Tinker leaped inta the cellar, and, unmasking his lantern, showed a sort of hiding-place, between a bulk of timber and a boilor, to which he invited his companion. The Sandman jumped down. @Ihe ale I drank at the IT@o Fighting Cocks' has made me feel drawsy, Tinker,'' he remarked, stretching himsolf on the bulk; @I@l1 just take a snooze.

Slightly altering his position, the Sandman caught sight of a figure standing upon the planks above them. It was] that of s young man. His hat was off, and his features, exposed to the full radiance of the moon, looked denthly pale, and though handsome, had a strange sinister expression. He was tall, slight, and well-proportioned; and the general cnt of his attire, the tightly-bnttoned, single-breasted coat, together with the moustache upon his lip, gave him@a military sir. @He seems a-valkin' in his sleep,'' mnttered the Sandman. @He's a-speakin' to some von unwisible.'' @Hush-hushl'' whispered the other.

Making a sign to the Sandman, who was elose at his hecols, the Tinker crept forward on all fonrs, and, on reaching the window, raised himself just sufficiently to command the interior of tha dwelling. Unfortunately for him, the moon was at this moment obscured, and he conld distinguish nothing- except the dnsky ontline of tho varions oljects with which the place was filled, and which were@nearly of the samo kind as those of the neighbouring habitation.
