Ar that festive season, when the days are at the shortest, and the nights at the longest, and when, consequently, it is the invariable practice of all sensible people to turn night into day ; when the state of the odds between business and pleasure is decidedly in favour of the latter; when high carnival is held in London, and everything betokens the prevalence and influence of good cheer; when pastrycooks are in their glory, and green trays in requisition; when porters groan beneath hampers of game, and huge tubs of Canterbury brawn ; when trains arriving from the eastern counties are heavy laden with turkeys and hares; when agents in town send barrels of oysters to correspondents in the country; when Christmas-box claimants disturb one’s equanimity by day, and Waits (those licensed nuisances, to 204 THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. which even our reverence for good old customs cannot reconcile us) break one’s first slumber at night; when surly Christians “awake,” and salute the band of little carollers with jugs of cold water; when their opposite neighbour, who has poked his nightcapped head from his window, retires with a satisfactory chuckle; when the meat at Mr. Giblett’s in Bond-street, which, for the last six weeks, has announced the approach of Christmas by its daily-increasing layers of fat, as correctly as the almanack, has reached the ne-plus-ultra of adiposity ; when wondering crowds are collected before the aforesaid Giblett’s to gaze upon the yellow carcase of that leviathan prize ox—the fat being rendered more intensely yellow by its contrast with the green holly with which it is garnished—as well as to admire the snowy cakes of suet with which the sides of that Leicestershire sheep are loaded; when the grocer’s trade is “in request,” and nothing is heard upon his counter but the jingling of scales and the snapping of twine; when the vendor of sweetmeats, as he deals fort. his citron and sultanas in the due minced-meat proportiuns to that pretty housemaid, whispers something in a soft and sugared tone about the mistletoe; when “coming Twelfth Nights cast their shadows before,” and Mr. Gunter feels doubly important; when pantomimes are about to unfold all their magic charms, and the holidays have fairly commenced; when the meteorological prophet predicts that Thursday the Ist will be fair and frosty, and it {urns out to be drizzling rain and a sudden THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. 205 thaw; when intelligence is brought that the ice “ bears,” the intelligence being confirmed by the appearance of sundry donkey-carts, containing ice an inch thick, and rendered indisputable by the discharge of their crystal loads upon the pavement before Mr. Grove’s, the fishmonger’s; when crack performers in paletots, or Mackintoshes, with skates in their hands, cigars in their mouths, and tights and fur-topped boots on their lower limbs, are seen hastening up Bakerstreet, in the direction of the Regent's Park; when a marquee is pitched upon the banks of the Serpentine, and a quadrille executed by the before-mentioned crack skaters in tights and fur-topped boots upon its frozen waters; when the functionaries of the Humane Society begin to find some employment for their ropes and punt; when Old Father Thames, who, for a couple of months, appears to have been undecided about the colours of his livery—now inclining to a cloak of greyish dun, now to a mantle of orange tawny— has finally adopted a white transparent robe with facings of silver; when, as you pass down Harley-street, the lights in the drawing-room windows of every third house, the shadows on the blinds, and, above all, the enlivening sound of the harp and piano, satisfy you that its fair inmate is “ at home ;” when House-quakes, street-thunders, and door-batteries are heard from “ midnight until morn ;” when the knocker at No. 22, Park-street, responds to the knocker at No. 25; 208 THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. Sir Lionel Flamstead. I have called it a dining-room, from its ordinary application to the purposes of refection and festivity ; but it had much more the air of a library, or study. It was a small comfortable chamber, just large enough to contain half a dozen people, though by management double that number had been occasionally squeezed into its narrow limits. The walls were decorated with curious old prints, maps and plans, set in old black wormeaten frames, and representing divers personages, places, and structures connected with London and its history. Over the mantelpiece was stretched Vertue’s copy of Ralph Aggas’s famous survey of our “ great metropolis,” made about the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign, or perhaps « little earlier, when it was scarcely so great a metropolis as at the present time, and when novelists, gentlemen of the press, cabmen, omnibus cads, and other illustrious personages were unborn and undreamed of; when St. Giles’s, in lieu of its mysterious and Dedalian Seven Dials (which should have for their motto Wordsworth’s title, “ We are Seven”), consisted of a little cluster of country houses, surrounded by a grove of elms; when a turreted wall girded in the City, from Aldgate to Grey Friars; when a pack of stag-hounds was kept in Finsbury-fields, and archers and cross-bowmen haunted the purlicus of the Spital; when he who strolled westward from Charing-cross (then no misnomer) beheld neither Opera House nor club-house, but a rustic lane, with a barn at one end, and a goodly assortment THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. 209 of hay-carts and hay-stacks at the other; when the Thames was crossed by a single bridge, and that bridge looked like a street, and the street itself like a row of palaces. On the right of this plan hung a sketch of Will Somers, jester to Henry VIIL., after the picture by Holbein; on the left an engraving of Geoffrey Hudson, the diminutive attendant of Henrietta Maria. This niche was devoted to portraits of the bluff king before mentioned, and his six spouses; that to the melancholy Charles and his family. Here, the Great Fire of 1666, with its black profiles of houses, relieved by a sheet of “bloody and malicious” flame, formed a pleasant contrast to the icy wonders of the Frost Fair, held on the Thames in 1684, when carriages were driven through the . lines of tents, and an ox was roasted on the water, to the infinite delectation of the citizens. There Old Saint Paul’s (in the words of Victor Hugo, “ one of those Gothic monuments so admirable and so irreparable”), and which is but ill replaced by the modern “ bastard counterpart” of the glorious fane of St. Peter at Rome, reared its venerable tower (not dome) and lofty spire to the sky. Next to St. Paul’s came the reverend Abbey of Westminster, taken before it had been disfigured by the towers added by Wren; and next to the abbey opened the long and raftered vista of its magnificent neighbouring hall. Several plans and prospects of the Tower of London, as it appeared at different epochs, occupied a corner to themselves: then came a long array of taverns, from the Tabard in South 210 THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. wark, the Boar’s Head in Eastcheap, and the Devil near Temple-bar, embalmed in the odour of poesy, to the Nag’s Head in Cheapside, notorious for its legend of the consecration of the Protestant bishops in 1559; there also might you see— — in Billinsgate the Salutation, And the Boar’s Head near Londcn Stone, The Swan at Dowgate, a tavern well known; The Mitre in Cheap, and then the Bull's Head, And many like places that make noses red ; The Boar’s Head in Old Fish-street ; Three Crowns in the Vintry; And, now, of late, Saint Martin's in the Seutree ; The Windmill in Lothbury; the Ship at th’ Exchange; King’s Head in New Fish-street, where roysters do range; ‘The Mermaid in Cornhill; Red Lion in the Strand ; Three Tuns in Newgate Market; in Old Fish-street the Swan. Adjoining these places of entertainment were others of a different description, to wit, the Globe, as it stood when Shakspeare (how insufferable is Mr. Knight’s orthography of this reverend name—Shakspere) trod the stage; the king’s play-honse in Charles the Second’s time; the Beargarden, with its flag streaming to the wind; and the Folly, as it once floated in the river, opposite old Somerset House. Then came the Halls, beginning with Guildhall and ending with Old Skinner’s. Next, the Crosses, from Paul's to Charing; then, the churches, gateways, hospitals, colleges, prisons, asylums, inns of court,—in short, for it is needless to particularise further, London and its thousand recollec * News from Bartholomew Faire. THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. 211 tions rose before you, as you gazed around. Scarcely an old edifice, to which an historical tradition could be attached (and what old London edifice is destitute of such traditions 7), was wanting. Nor were the great of old—the spirits, who gave interest and endurance to these decayed, or decaying structures, wanting. But I shall not pause to enumerate their portraits, or make out a catalogue as long as the list of Homer’s ships, or the gallery of Mr. Lodge. Sufficient has been said, I trust, to give the reader an idea of the physiology of the room. Yet stay! I must not omit ta point out the contents of those groaning shelves. In the goodly folios crowded there are contained the chronicles of Holinshed and Hall; of Grafton, Fabian, and Stow; of Mathew of Paris, and his namesake of Westminster. Let him not be terrified at the ponderous size of these admirable old historians, nor be deterred by the black letter, if he should chance to open a volume. Their freshness and picturesque details will surprise as much as they will delight him. From this wealthy mine Shakspeare drew some of his purest ore. The shelves are crowned bya solitary bust. It is that of a modern. It is that of a lover of London, and a character of London. It is Docror Jounson. Having completed the survey of the apartment, I shall now proceed to its occupants. These were five in number —jolly fellows all—seated round a circular dining-table covered with glasses and decanters, amidst which a portly magnum of claret, and a deep and capacious china punch P2 212 THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. bowl, must not pass unmentioned. They were in the full flow of fun and conviviality ; enjoying themselves as good fellows always enjoy themselves at “ the season of the year.” The port was delectable—old as Saint Paul's, I was going to say—not quite, however—but just “old enongh;” the claret was nectar, or, what is better, it was Lafitte; the punch was drink for the gods. The jokes of this party would have split your sides—their laughter would have had the same effect on your ears. Never were heard peals of merriment so hearty and prolonged. You only wondered how they found time to drink, so quick did each roar follow on the heels of its predecessor. That they did drink, however, was clear; that they had drunk was equally certain ; and that they intended to continue drinking seemed to come within the limits of probability. Sir Lionel Flamstead was a retired merchant—one of those high-souled, high-principled traders, of whom our City was once so justly proud, and of whom so few, in these days of railway bubbles, and other harebrained speculations, can be found. His word was his bond—once passed, it was sufficient; his acceptances were accounted safe as the Bank of England. Had Sir Thomas Gresham descended from his niche he could not have been treated with greater consideration than attended Sir Lionel’s appearance on ""Change. All eyes followed the movements of his tall and stately figure—all hats were raised to his courteous but ceremonious salutation. Affable, yet precise, and tinctured THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. 213 with something of the punctitiousness of the old school, his manners won him universal respect and regard, even from those unknown to him. By his intimates he was revered. His habits were as regular as clockwork, and the glass of cold punch at Tom’s, or the basin of soup at Birch’s, wound him up for the day. His attire was as formal as his manners, being a slight modification of the prevalent costume of some five-and-thirty years ago. He had consented, not without extreme reluctance, to clothe his nether limbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction ; but he resolutely adhered to the pigtail. There is something, by-the-by, in a pigtail, to which old gentlemen cling in spite of all remonstrance, with lover-like pertinacity. Only hint the propriety of cutting it off to your great-uncle or your grandfather, and you may rely on being cut off with a shilling yourself. Be this as it may, Sir Lionel gathered his locks, once sable as the riband that bound them, but now thickly strewn with the silver “ blossoms of the grave,” into a knot, and suffered them to dangle a few inches below his collar. His shoes shone with a lustre beyond French polish, and his hat was brushed till not a wind dared to approach it. Sir Lionel wore a white, unstarched cravat, with a thick pad in it, sported a frill over his waistcoat, carried a black ebony cane in his hand, and was generally followed by a pet pug-dog, one of the most sagacious and disagreeable specimens of his species. Sir Lionel Flamstead, I have said, was tall—I might have said he was very tall—some 214 THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. what narrower across the shoulders than about the hips—a circumstance which did not materially conduce to his symmetry—with grey, benevolent eyes, shaded by bushy, intelligent brows—a lofty, expansive forehead, in which, in the jargon of phrenology, the organs of locality and ideality were strongly developed, and which was rendered the more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on either side of the temples—with a nose which had been considered handsome and well proportioned in his youth, but to which good living had imparted a bottle form and a bottle tint—and cheeks from which all encroachment of whiskers was sedulously removed, in order, we conclude, that his rosy complexion might be traced from its point of concentration, upon the prominent feature befere mentioned, to its final disappearance behind his ears. Such was Sir Lionel Flamstead. . ° e ° A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME, L SANTA MARIA MAGGIORE. “The Pope was saying the high, high mass, All on Saint Peter’s day; With the power to him given by the saints in heaven Tc wash men’s sins away. “The Pope he was saying the blessed mass, And the people kneel’d around; And from each man’s soul his sins did pass, As he kissed the holy ground.” The Gray Brother, Cuaxcrxe to be in Rome in the August of 1830, 1 visited the gorgeous church of Santa Maria Maggiore during the celebration of the anniversary of the Holy Assumption. It was a glorious sight to one unaccustomed to the imposing religious ceremonials of the Romish church, to wit 216 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. ness all the pomp and splendour displayed at this high solemnity—to gaze down that glittering pile, and mark the various ecclesiastical dignitaries, each in their peculiar and characteristic costume, employed in the ministration of their sacred functions, and surrounded by a wide semicircle of the papal guards, 60 stationed to keep back the crowd, and who, with their showy scarlet attire and tall halberds, looked like the martial figures we see in the sketches of Callot. Nor was the brilliant effect of this picture diminished by the sumptuous framework in which it was set. Overhead flamed a roof resplendent with burnished gold ; before me rose a canopy supported by pillars of porphyry, and shining with many-coloured stones; while on either hand were chapels devoted to some noble house, and boasting each the marble memorial of a pope. Melodious masses proper to the service were ever and anon chanted by the papal choir, and overpowering perfume was diffused around by a hundred censers. Subdued by the odours, the music, and the spectacle, I sank into a state of dreamy enthusiasm, during a continuance of which I almost fancied myself a convert to the faith of Rome, and surrendered myself unreflectingly to an admiration of its errors. As I gazed among the surrounding crowd, the sight of so many prostrate figures, all in attitudes of deepest devotion, satisfied me of the profound religious impression of the ceremonial. As elsewhere, this feeling was not universal; and, as elsewhere, likewise, more A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 217 zeal was exhibited by the lower than the higher classes of society ; and I occasionally noted amongst the latter the glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom, not altogether agitated, I suspect, by holy aspirations. Yet methought, on the whole, I had never scen such abandonment of soul, such prostration of spirit, in my own colder clime, and during the exercise of my own more chastened creed, as that which in several instances I now beheld; and I almost envied the poor maiden near me, who, abject upon the earth, had washed away her sorrows, and perhaps her sins, in contrite tears. . As such thoughts swept through my mind, I felt a pleasure in singling out particular figures and groups which interested me, from their peculiarity of costume, or from their devotional fervour. Amongst others, a little to my left, I remarked a band of mountaineers from Calabria, for such J judged them to be from their wild and picturesque garb. Deeply was every individual of this little knot of peasantry impressed by the ceremonial. Every eye was humbly cast down; every knee bent; every hand was either occupied in grasping the little crucifix suspended from its owner's neck, in telling the beads of his rosary, or fervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast. While gazing upon this group, I chanced upon an individual whom I had not hitherto noticed, and who now irresistibly attracted my attention. Though a little removed from the Calabrian mountaineers, and reclining against the 218 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. marble walls of the church, he evidently belonged to the same company; at least, so his attire seemed to indicate, though the noble cast of his countenance was far superior to that of his comrades. He was an old man, with a face of the fine antique Roman stamp—a bold outline of prominent nose, rugged and imperious brow, and proudly-cut chin. His head and chin, as well as his naked breast, were frosted over with the snowy honours of many winters, and their hoar appearance contrasted strikingly with the tawny hue of a skin almost as dark and as lustrous as polished oak. Peasant as he was, there was something of grandeur and majesty in this old man’s demeanour and physiognomy. His head declined backwards, so as completely to expose his long and muscular throat. His arms hung listlessly by his side; one hand drooped upon the pavement, the other was placed within his breast: his eyes were closed. The old man’s garb was of the coarsest fabric; he wore little beyond a shirt, a loose vest, a sort of sheep-skin cloak, and canvas leggings bound around with leathern thongs. His appearance, however, was above his condition; he became his rags as proudly as a prince would have become his ermined robe. The more I scrutinised the rigid lines of this old man’s countenance, the more I became satisfied that many singular, and perhaps not wholly guiltless, events were connected with his history. The rosary was in his hand—the cross upon his breast—the beads were untold—the crucifix A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 219 unclasped -—no breath of prayer passed his lips. His face was turned heavenward, but his eyes were closed,—he dared not open them. Why did he come thither, if he did not venture to pray? Why did he assume a penitential attitude, if he felt no penitence? So absorbed was I in the perusal of the workings of this old man’s countenance, as to be scarcely conscious that the service of high mass was concluded, and the crowd within the holy pile fast dispersing. The music was hushed, the robed prelates and their train had disappeared, joyous dames were hastening along the marble aisles to their equipages ; all, save a few kneeling figures near the chapels, were departing ; and the old man, aware, from the stir and hum prevailing around, that the ceremonial was at an end, arose, stretched out his arm to one of his comrades, a youth who had joined him, and prepared to follow the concourse. Was he really blind? Assuredly not. Besides, he did not walk like as one habituated to the direst calamity that can befal our nature. He staggered in his gait, and reeled to and fro. Yet wherefore did he not venture to unclose his eyes within the temple of the Most High? What would I not have given to be made acquainted with his history ! For I felt that it must be a singular one. I might satisfy my curiosity at once. He was moving slowly forward, guided by his comrade. In a few seconds it would be too late—he would have vanished from my sight. With hasty footsteps I followed him down the 220 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. church, and laid my hand, with some violence, upon his shoulder. The old man started at the touch, and turned. Now, indeed, his eyes were opened wide, and flashing full upon me,—and such eyes! Heretofore I had only dreamed of such. Age had not quenched their lightning, and I quailed beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me. But if Iwas, at first, surprised at the display of anger which I had called forth in him, how much more was I astonished to behold the whole expression of his countenance suddenly change. His eyes continued fixed upon mine as if I had been a basilisk. Apparently he could not avert them; while his whole frame shivered with emotion. I advanced towards him; he shrank backwards, and, but for the timely aid of his companion, would have fallen upon the pavement. At a loss to conceive in what way I could have occasioned him so much alarm, I rushed forward to the assistance of the old man, when his son, for such it subsequently appeared he was, rudely repelled me, and thrust his hand into his girdle, as if to seek for means to prevent further interference. Meanwhile the group had been increased by the arrival of a third party, attracted by the cry the old man had uttered in falling. The new comer was an Italian gentleman, somewhat stricken in years; of stern and stately deportment, and with something sinister and forbidding in his A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 221 aspect. He was hastening towards the old man, but he suddenly stopped, and was about to retire when he encountered my gaze. As our eyes met he started; and a terror, as sudden and lively as that exhibited by the old man, was at once depicted in his features. My surprise was now beyond all bounds, and I continued for some moments speechless with astonishment. Not a little of the inexplicable awe which affected the old man and the stranger was communicated to myself. Altogether, we formed a mysterious and terrible triangle, of which each side bore some strange and unintelligible relation to the other. The new comer first recovered his composure, though not without an effort. Coldly turning his heel upon me, he walked towards the old man, and shook him forcibly. The latter shrank from his grasp, and endeavoured to avoid him ; but it was impossible. The stranger whispered a few words in his ear, of which, from his gestures being directed towards myself, I could guess the import. The old man replied. His action in doing so was that of supplication and despair, The stranger retorted in a wild and vehement manner, and even stamped upon the ground; but the old man still continued to cling to the knees of his superior. “Weak, superstitious fool!” at length exclaimed the stranger, “ I will waste no more words upon thee. Do, or say, what thou wilt; but beware!” And spurning him haughtily back with his foot, he strode away. 222 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. The old man’s reverend head struck against the marble floor. His temple was cut open by the fall, and blood gushed in torrents from the wound. Recovering himself, he started to his feet-—a knife was instantly in his hand, and he would have pursued and doubtless slain his aggressor, if he had not been forcibly withheld by his son, and by a priest who had joined them. “ Maledizione!” exclaimed the old man—“ a blow from him—from that hand! I will stab him, though he were at the altar’s foot; though he had a thousand lives, each should pay for it. Release me, Paolo! release me! for, by Heaven ! he dies !” “ Peace, father!” cried the son, still struggling with him. “ Thou art not my son, to hinder my revenge !” shouted the enraged father. “ Dost not see this blood—my blood —thy father’s blood ?—and thou holdest me back! Thou shouldst have struck him to the earth for the deed—but he was a noble, and thou daredst not lift thy hand against him !” “ Wouldst thou have had me slay him in this holy place ?” exclaimed Paolo, reddening with anger and suppressed emotion. “No, no,” returned the old man, in an altered voice; “not here, not here, though ""twere but just retribution. But I will find other means of vengeance. I will denounce A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 223 him—TI will betray all, though it cost me my own life! He shall die by the hands of the common executioner ;—there is one shall testify for me!"" And he pointed to me. Again I advanced towards him. “If thou hast aught to disclose pertaining to the Holy Church, I am ready to listen to thee, my son,” said the priest; “but reflect well ere thou bringest any charge thou mayest not be able to substantiate against one who stands so high in her esteem as him thou wouldst accuse.” The son gave his father a meaning look, and whispered somewhat in his ear. The old man became suddenly still. “ Right, right,” said he; “I have bethought me. ""Iwas but a Llow. He is wealthy, I am poor; there is no justice for the poor in Rome.” “ My purse is at your service,” said I, interfering ; “you shall haye my aid.” “ Your aid!” echoed the old man, staring at me; “ will you assist me, signor ?” “Twill.” “Enough. I may claim fulfilment of your promise.” “ Stop, old man,” I said; “ answer me one question ere you depart. Whence arose your recent terrors ?” “ You shall know hereafter, signor,” he said; “I must now begone. We shall meet again. Follow me not,” he continued, seeing I was bent upon obtaining further explanation of the mystery. “ You will learn nothing now, and 224 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME, only endanger my safety. Addio, signor.” And with hasty steps he quitted the church, accompanied by his son. “Who is that old man ?” I demanded of the priest. “T am as ignorant as yourself,” he replied, “ but he must be looked to; he talks threateningly.” And he beckoned to an attendant. “Who was he who struck him ?” was my next inquiry. “One of our wealthiest nobles,” he replied, “and an assured friend of the church. We could ill spare him. Do not lose sight of them,” he added to the attendant, “ and let the sbirri track them to their haunts. They must not be suffered to go forth to-night. A few hours’ restraint will cool their hot Calabrian blood.” “ But the name of the noble, father?” I said, renewing my inquiries. “ T must decline further questioning,” returned the priest, coldly. “I have other occupation; and meanwhile it will be well to have these stains effaced, which may else bring scandal on these holy walls. You will excuse me, my son.” So saying, he bowed and retired. I made fruitless inquiries for the old man at the door of the church. He was gone; none of the bystanders who had seen him go forth knew whither. Stung by curiosity, I wandered amid the most unfrequented quarters of Rome throughout the day, in the hope of mecting with the old Calabrian, but in vain. As, however, I entered the court-yard of my hotel, I fancied I dis A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 225 covered, amongst the lounging assemblage gathered round the door, the dark eyes of the younger mountaineer. In this I might have been mistaken. No one answering to his description had been seen near the house. IL THE MARCHESA, Une chose ténébreuse fait par des hommes ténébreux.—Lucrecs Boraa. On the same night I bent my steps towards the Colosseum; and, full of my adventure of the morning, found myself, not without apprehension, involved within its labyrinthine passages. Accompanied by a monk, who, with a small horn lantern in his hand, acted as my guide, I fancied that, by its uncertain light, I could discover stealthy figures lurking within the shades of the ruin. Whatever suspicions I might entertain, I pursued my course in silence. Emerging from the vomitorio, we stood upon the steps of the colossal amphitheatre. The huge pile was bathed in rosy moonlight, and reared itself in serene majesty before my view. While indulging in a thousand speculations, occasioned by the hour and the spot, I suddenly perceived a figure on a point of the ruin immediately above me. Nothing but the head was visible; but that was placed in bold relief Q 226 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME, against the beaming sky of night, and I recognised it at once. No nobler Roman head had ever graced the circus when Rome was in her zenith. I shouted to the old Calabrian, for he it was I beheld. Almost ere the sound had left my lips, he had disappeared. I made known what I had seen to the monk. He was alarmed—urged our instant departure, and advised me to seek the assistance of the sentinel stationed at the entrance to the pile. To this proposal I assented; and, having descended the vasty steps and crocsed the open arena, we arrived, without molestation, at the doorway. The sentinel had allowed no one to pass him. He returned with me to the circus; and, after an ineffectual search amongst the ruins, volunteered his services to accompany me homewards through the Forum. I declined his offer, and shaped my course towards a lonesome vicolo on the right. This was courting danger; but I cared not, and walked slowly forward through the deserted place. Scarcely had I proceeded many paces, when I heard footsteps swiftly approaching; and, ere I could tuin round, my arms were seized from behind, and a bandage was passed across my eyes. All my efforts at liberation were unarsiling; and, after a brief struggle, I remained passive. “Make no noise,” said a voice which I knew to be that of the old man, “and no harm shall befal you. You must come with us. Ask no questions, but follow.” I suffered myself to be led, without further opposition, A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 227 whithersoever they listed. We walked for it might be half an hour, much beyond the walls of Rome. I had to scramble through many ruins, and frequently stumbled over inequalities of ground. I now felt the fresh brecze of night blowing over the wide campagna, and my conductors moved swiftly onwards as we trod on its elastic turf. At length they came to a halt. My bandage was removed, and I beheld myself beneath the arch of an aqueduct, which spanned the moonlit plain. A fire was kindled beneath the arch, and the ruddy flame licked its walls. Around the blaze were grouped the little band of peasantry I had beheld within the church, in various and picturesque attitudes. They greeted my conductors on their arrival, and glanced inquisitively at me, but did not speak to me. The elder Calabrian, whom they addressed as Cristofano, asked for a glass of aqua vite, which he handed respectfully to me. I declined the offer, but he pressed it upon me. “ You will need it, signor,” he said; “you have much to do to-night. You fear, perhaps, it is drugged. Behold!” And he drank it off. I could not, after this, refuse his pledge. “ And now, signor,” said the old man, removing to a little distance from the group, “may I crave a word with you—your name ?” As I had no reason for withholding it, I told him how I was called. “Hum! Had you no relation of the name of ——?” 228 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME, “None whatever.” And I sighed, for I thought of my desolate condition. “ Strange!” he muttered; adding, with a grim smile, “but, however, likenesses are easily accounted for.” “ What likenesses?” I asked. “ Whom do I resemble ? and what is the motive of your inexplicable conduct ?” “ You shall hear,” he replied, frowning gloomily. “ Step aside, and let us get within the shade of these arches, out of the reach of yonder listeners, The tale I have to tell is for your ears alone.” I obeyed him; and we stood beneath the shadow of the aqueduct. “ Years ago,” began the old man, “an Englishman, in all respects resembling yourself, equally well-favoured in person, and equally young, came to Rome, and took up his abode within the eternal city. He was of high rank in his own country, and was treated with the distinction due tu his exalted station here. At that time I dwelt with the Marchese di I was his confidential servant—his adviser—his friend. I had lived with his father—carried him as an infant—sported with him as a boy—loved and served him asa man. Loved him, I say; for, despite his treatment of me, I loved him then as much as I abhor him now. Well! signor, to my story. If his youth had been profligate, his manhood was not less depraved; it was devoted to cold, calculating libertinism. Soon after he succeeded to the estates and title of his father, he married. That he A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 229 loved his bride, I can scarcely believe; for, though he was wildly jealous of her, he was himself unfaithful, and she knew it. In Italy, revenge, in such cases, is easily within @ woman’s power; and, for aught I know, the marchesa might have meditated retaliation. My lord, however, took the alarm, and thought fit to retire to his villa without the city, and for a time remained secluded within its walls. It was at this crisis that the Englishman I have before mentioned arrived in Rome. My lady, who mingled little with the gaieties of the city, had not beheld him; but she could not have been unacquainted with him by report, as every tongue was loud in his praises. A rumour of his successes with other dames had reached my lord; nay, I have reason to believe that he had been thwarted by the handsome Englishman in some other quarter, and he sedulously prevented their meeting. An interview, however, did take place between them, and in an unexpected manner, It was the custom then, as now, upon particular occasions, to drive, during the heats of summer, within the Piazza Navona, which is flooded with water. One evening the marchesa drove thither: she was unattended, except by myself. Our carriage happened to be stationed near that of the young Englishman.” “The marchesa was beautiful, no doubt ?” I said, interrupting him. “ Most beautiful!” he replied; “and so your countryman seemed to think, for he was lost in admiration of her. | 230 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME, T am not much versed in the language of the eyes, but his were too eloquent and expressive not to be understood. I watched my mistress narrowly. It was evident from her glowing cheek, though her eyes were cast down, that she was not insensible to his regards. She turned to play with her dog, a lovely little greyhound, which was in the carriage beside her, and patted it carelessly with the glove which she held in her hand. The animal snatched the glove from her grasp, and, as he bounded backwards, fell over the carriage side. My lady uttered a scream at the sight, and I was preparing to extricate the struggling dog, when the Englishman plunged into the water. In an instant he had restored her favourite to the marchesa, and received her warmest acknowledgments. From that moment an intimacy commenced, which was destined to produce the most fatal consequences to both parties.” “Did you betray them ?” I asked, somewhat impatiently. “ T was then the blind tool of the marchese. I did so,” replied the old man. “TI told him all particulars of the interview. He heard me in silence, but grew ashy pale with suppressed rage. Bidding me redouble my vigilance, he left me. My lady was now scarcely ever out of my sight; when one evening, a few days after what had occurred, she walked forth alone upon the garden-terrace of the villa. Her guitar was in her hand, and her favourite dog by her side. I was at a little distance, but wholly unperceived. She struck a few plaintive chords upon her A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 231 instrument, and then, resting her chin upon her white and rounded arm, seemed lost in tender reverie. Would you had seen her, signor, as I beheld her then, or as one other beheld her! you would acknowledge that you had never met with her equal in beauty. Her raven hair fell in thick tresses over shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most perfect proportion. Her deep dark eyes were thrown languidly on the ground, and her radiant features were charged with an expression of profound and pensive passion. “Tn this musing attitude she continued for some minutes, when she was aroused by the gambols of her dog, who bore in his mouth a glove which he had found. As she took it from him, a letter dropped upon the floor. Had a serpent glided from its folds, it could not have startled her more. She gazed upon the paper, offended, but irresolute. Yes, she was irresolute ; and you may conjecture the rest. She paused, and by that pause was lost. With a shrinking grasp she stooped to raise the letter. Her cheeks, which had grown deathly pale, again kindled with blushes as she perused it. She hesitated—cast a bewildering look towards the mansion—placed the note within her bosom—and plunged into the orange-bower.” “ Her lover awaited her there ?” “He did. I saw them meet. I heard his frenzied words —his passionate entreaties. He urged her to fly—she resisted. He grew more urgent—more impassioned. She uttered a faint cry, and I stood before them. The English 232 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. man's hand was at my throat, and his sword at my breast, with the swiftness of thought; and but for the screams of my mistress, that instant must have been my last. At her desire he relinquished his hold of me; but her cries had reached other ears, and the marchese arrived to avenge his injured honour. He paused not to inquire the nature of the offence, but, sword in hand, assailed the Englishman, bidding me remove his lady. The clash of their steel was drowned by her shrieks as I bore her away; but I knew the strife was desperate. Before I gained the house my lady had fainted; and, committing her to the charge of other attendants, I returned to the terrace. I met my master slowly walking homewards. His sword was gone— his brow was bent—he shunned my sight. I knew what had happened, and did not approach him. He sought his wife. What passed in that interview was never disclosed, but it may be guessed at from its result. That night the marchesa left her husband's halls—never to return. Next morn I visited the terrace where she had received the token. The glove was still upon the ground. I picked it up and carried it to the marchese, detailing the whole occurrence to him. He took it, and vowed as he took it that his vengeance should never rest satisfied till that glove had been steeped in her blood.” “ And he kept his vow ?” I asked, shuddering. “Many months elapsed ere its accomplishment. Italian vengeance is slow, but sure. To all outward appearance, A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 233 he had forgotten his faithless wife. He had even formed a friendship with her lover, which he did the more effectually to blind his ultimate designs. Meanwhile, time rolled on, and the marchesa gave birth to a child—the offspring cf her seducer.” “ Great God !” I exclaimed, “ was that child a boy ?” “It was—but listen to me. My tale draws to a close. One night, during the absence of the Englishman, by secret means we entered the palazzo where the marchesa resided. We wandered from room to room till we came to her chamber. She was sleeping, with her infant by her side. The sight maddened the marchese. He would have stricken the child, but I held back his hand. He relented. Ie bade me make fast the door. He approached the bed. I heard a rustle—a scream. A white figure sprang from out the couch. In an instant the light was extinguished— there was a blow—another—and all was over. I threw open the door. The marchese came forth. The corridor in which we stood was flooded with moonlight. A glove was in his hand—it was dripping with blood. His oath was fulfilled—his vengeance complete—no, not complete, for the Englishman yet lived.” “ What became of him ?” I inquired. “ Ask me not,” replied the old man; “ you were at the Chiesa Santa Maria Maggiore this morning. If those stones could speak, they might tell a fearful story.” “ And that was the reason you did not dare to unciose 234 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. your eyes within those holy precincts?—a film of blood floated between you and heaven.” The old man shuddered, but replied not. “And the child?” I asked, after a pause; “ what of their wretched offspring 2?” “ Tt was conveyed to England by a friend of its dead father. If he were alive, that boy would be about your age, signor.” “Indeed !"" I said; a horrible suspicion flashing across my mind. “ After the Englishman’s death,” continued Cristofano, “my master began to treat me with a coldness and suspicion which increased daily. I was a burden to him, and he was resolved to rid himself of me. I spared him the trouble—quitted Rome—sought the mountains of the Abruzzi—and thence wandered to the fastnesses of Calabria, and became—no matter what. Here I am, Heaven’s appointed minister of vengeance. The marchese dies tonight !” “To-night! old man,” I echoed, horror-stricken. “ Add not crime to crime. If he has indeed been guilty of the foul offence you have named, let him be dealt with according to the offended laws of the country. Do not pervert the purposes of justice.” “ Justice !” echoed Cristofano, scornfully. “ Ay, justice. You are poor and powerless, but means yy A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 235 may be found to aid you. I will assist the rightful course of vengeance.” “ You shall assist it. Ihave sworn he shall die before dawn, and the hand to strike the blow shall be yours.” “ Mine !—never !” “ Your own life will be the penalty of your obstinacy, if you refuse; nor will your refusal save him. By the Mother of Heaven, he dies! and by your hand. You saw how he was struck by your resemblance to the young Englishman this morning in the chiesa, It is wonderful! I know not who or what you are; but to me you are an instrument of vengeance, and as such I shall use you. The blow dealt by you will seem the work of retribution; and I care not if you strike twice, and make my heart your second mark.” Ere I could reply he called to his comrades, and in a few moments we were speeding across the campagna. We arrived at a high wall: the old man conducted us to @ postern-gate, which he opened. We entered a garden filled with orange-trees, the perfume of which loaded the midnight air. We heard the splash of a fountain at a distance, and the thrilling notes of a nightingale amongst some taller trees. The moon hung like a lamp over the belvidere of the proud villa. We strode along a wide terrace edged by a marble balustrade. The old man pointed to an open summer-house terminating the walk, and gave me 4 significant look, but he spoke not. A window thrown 236 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME, open admitted us to the house. We were within a hall crowded with statues, and traversed noiselessly its marble floors, Passing through several chambers, we then mounted to a corridor, and entered an apartment which formed the ante-room to another beyond it. Placing his finger upon his lips, and making a sign to his comrades, Cristofano opened a door and disappeared. There was a breathless pause for a few minutes, during which I listened intently, but caught only a faint sound as of the snapping of a lock. Presently the old man returned. “ He sleeps,” he said, in a low deep tone to me; “ sleeps as his victim slept—sleeps without a dream of remorse; and he shall awaken, as she awoke, to despair. Come into his chamber !” We obeyed. The door was made fast within side. The curtains of the couch were withdrawn, and the moonlight streamed full upon the face of the sleeper. He was hushed in profound repose. No visions seemed to haunt his peaceful slumbers. Could guilt sleep so soundly? I half doubted the old man’s story. Placing us within the shadow of the canopy, Cristofano approached the bed. A stiletto glittered in his hand. « Awake !” he cried, in a voice of thunder. The sleeper started at the summons. I watched his countenance. He read Cristofano’s errand in his eye. But he quailed not. A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 237 “ Cowardly assassin !” he cried, “ you have well consulted your own safety in stealing on my slecp.” “ And who taught me the lesson?” fiercely interrupted the old man. Aw I the first that have stolen on midnight slumber? Gaze upon this? When and how did it acquire its dye?” And he held forth a glove, which looked \ blackened and stained in the moonlight. The marchese groaned aloud. “ My cabinet broken open!” at length he exclaimed— “ villain! how dared you do this? But why doI rave? I know with whom I have to deal.” Uttering these words he sprung from his couch with the intention of grappling with the old man; but Cristofano retreated, and at that instant the brigands, who rushed to his aid, thrust me forward. I was face to face with the marchese. The apparition of the murdered man could not have staggered him more. His limbs were stiffened by the shock, and he remained in an attitude of freezing terror. “Ts he come for vengeance ?” he ejaculated. “He is!” cried Cristofano. “Give him the weapon!” And a stiletto was thrust into my hand. But I heeded not the stecl. I tore open my bosom—a small diamond cross was within the folds. “Do you recollect this ?” I demanded of the marchese. “Tt was my wife’s!” he shrieked, in amazement. “Tt was upon the infant’s bosom as he slept by her side 238 - A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. on that fatal night,” said Cristofano. “I saw it sparkle there.” “ That infant was myself—that wife my mother!” I cried. “The murderer stands before you! Strike!” exclaimed Cristofano. . T raised the dagger. The marchese stirred not. I could not strike. : “ Do you hesitate 2” angrily exclaimed Cristofano. “ He has not the courage,” returned the younger Calabrian. “You reproacked me this morning with want of filial duty. Behold how a son can avenge his father!” And he plunged his stiletto within the bosom of the marchese. “ Your father is not yet avenged, young man!” cried Cristofano, in a terrible tone. ‘ You alone can avenge him !” Ere I could wilndraw its point the old man had rushed upon the dagger which I held extended in my grasp. He fell without a single groan. NHE END, etinted by C. Warrtxc, Beaafort {louse, Dake St.. Linooln’s Ina Fields, NOVELS. From “The Times.” “« Among the most surprising instances of the immense revolution which has taken lace of late years in popular are the cheap publications of Messrs. RoutTedge and Co., of the Broadway. For several years they have been issuing the * Railway Library,’ and have shown an energy and enterprise in many fields of literature almost unparalleled in this country. We believe the great success which th have met with has arisen from the universally popular character of the works which they have issued. Their books are never above and never below the standard of public taste. Looking over their list of books, we cannot but wish the ‘ Railway Library’ a continuation of the immense sale which has hitherto attended it.” *.° The columns of prices show the forms in which the Books are kept—c.g., Ainsworth’s Novels are kept only in paper covers atis., or limp cloth gilt, ts. 6d.; Armstrong’s only in picture boards at 28., or half roan, 2s. 6d.
